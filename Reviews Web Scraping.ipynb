       "[\"This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.\\n\\nGood:\\n\\n- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!\\n- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.\\n- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.\\n- 6000 Mah battery is BIG\\n- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.\\n- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE\\n- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.\\n- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.\\n- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.\\n- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good\\n- Received next day by 11 AM !\\n\\nNot So Good:\\n\\n- Not that thin, but ok.\\n- Doesn't have Samsung Dex\\n- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth.

PROS.\\n(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.\\n(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome. For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.\\n(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.\\n(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.\\n(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.\\n(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.\\n(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.\\n4. CONS.\\n(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.\\n(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.\\n5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. üëç\",\n",

       " \"Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.\\nBut...\\nAlso read the rest\\n\\n‚Ä¢ PERFORMANCE\\nThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.\\n\\n‚Ä¢ DISPLAY\\nThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)\\n\\n‚Ä¢ BATTERY AND CHARGING\\nThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.\\n\\n‚Ä¢CAMERA\\nCamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.\\nMeanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.\\n\\n*CONCLUSION*\\nThe Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.\\n\\nThank you..\\n\\n(If you have any question regardingthis device. You can always drop them on the comment)\",\n",

It also has Dolby Atmos sound.\\nThe rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.\\nPlayed pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well.

I needed another phone but couldn't afford to get another expensive device after just losing one. When I read the specs for the M31 128GB (which seemed unreal) I decided to give it a shot. For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.\\nWhat of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.\\nSo if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP. I would have just liked it slightly smaller in size so it fit pockets and arm bands easily... But that's me.\",\n",

This phone is for the people who want a phone from a premium brand with sAmoled display , great set of cameras, decent processor AND THE BEST: VERY LOW SAR VALUE..

A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.\",\n",

       " 'I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.\\nThis phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.\\n\\nNow coming to the phone :\\n\\nPros :-\\n1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.\\n2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.\\n3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.\\n4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.\\n5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.\\n6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.\\nOther conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.\\n\\nNow coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :\\n1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.\\n2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.\\n3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.\\n\\nOverall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)',\n",

I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.\\nAfter this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.\\nI like the look & feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.\\nOverall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front & rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.\\nFor me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).\\nIn short, I would say, it is a value for money device.\\nI purchased the phone in March 2020, and by end of July 2020, I have received 2 security and feature updates.\\nI have used the camera in the last 5 months.

My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.\\n\\nDISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.\\nWith Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite U display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on back is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.\\n\\nBATTERY.\\nMain benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.\\n\\nCAMERA.\\nThis time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.\\n\\nPROCESSOR.\\nAfter using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY.\\nAfter using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.\\n\\nBang for the bucks go for it.

       " \"I recently purchased an M21 for my father and was more than happy with its overall performance, be it the camera, battery or software performance. Hence, decided to upgrade my mother's phone as well and Samsung M series being Proudly Made in India and a non Chinese but a Korean brand, ordered the M31 128GB.\\nTo my surprise, I was even more amazed when the phone arrived. Everything the M21 was best at, was carried over and the Camera performance was even more improved in every aspect.\\nThe sharpness, AF, colours, and also video performance was improved over M21 which itself is good.\\n\\nNo wonder the phone is selling like hot cakes all over India. My only regret now is, I didnt knew the M31s was launching. Else I would have waited for the M31s which going by the reviews, is a monster in Camera segment.\\nAnyway, since my moms and dads phones have been set and purchased already, I think I need a phone upgrade for myself and it sure will be a Samsung. Probably the upcoming A71S 5G or an A51s 5G since i have read up about the about to be released Samsung phones.\",\n",

Macro shot, food shot are good. Live bokeh on back cam is ok and front cam live bokeh will disappoint.\\nBattery backup is definitely better than a 3000 to 4000 mAh with snapdragon SOC.\\nGeneral processing, speed and animations are seamless.\\nif you are a fan of Samsung ui you would love it.\\nFinger print sensor is good as the best ones , it's fast enough.\\n\\nCons\\n\\nAudio quality with a Sony Bass headset is not so great, frequencies and noise cancellation is not soothing, cannot match a Nokia 6 Dolby, if you are music lover, this phone will disappoint you. Yet sound with a Bluetooth speaker was good. Surround effects on Dolby mode are good but audio quality needs some work.\\nI am not a fan of custom ui and someone used to the stock android & miss it, still can manage with launchers like Nova to get the stock android feel.\\nHas a lot of Samsung and third party apps which you have to disable. Some cannot be disabled as well. Of the 6GB, 1.5 GB is wasted on these apps. So you practically have only 3gb left after the OS and Samsung apps, which is not expected of 6gb ram device. A stock android phone will offer more RAM and processing power in reality, with the same hardware.\\nExynos is worthy for normal use and I am not sure about gaming as I have not tried.\\n\\nExtra memory and battery are in place because of the bloatware the phone ships in. These are not annoying like the ones on Micromax or cheaper phones. Most of these genuine ones, but one may not use them.\\nLarger battery makes the phone heavier, plastic body gives a false feel like the phone is not sturdy, the phone actually is pretty solid, if you have a case and glass you don't find a difference.\\n\\nOver all a worthy smartphone and worth its money.\",\n",

Motorola was fabulous before Lenovo took over. I disliked my last cheapy Lenovo Moto, switched to Redmi, and disliked its cheapy user experience even More!\\n\\nADVICE: Take a cut on small configurational benefits - the Chinese tempt you with that kind of (unimportant) stuff. The overall user experience of a Samsung vs the Redmi, is by Far, Worlds apart. Buy This over the Redmi ANY DAY.\\n\\nI FELT THIS WAY WITHIN 1 HR OF USING THE SAMSUNG PHONE, VS 1 YR OF USING THE REDMI NOTE 8.\\n\\nWish I could exchange the Redmi during this sale, but that is One brand which is not being taken in exchange offers on any phones.\\n\\nIts Like buying a Bad piece of real estate.. !',\n",
       " 'Let‚Äôs start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option.\\n\\nAnother area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos.\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Camera Review\\n\\nThe Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.\\n\\nGalaxy M31\\n\\nThat said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.\\n\\nIn low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements.\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security Review\\n\\nGalaxy M31\\n\\nThe smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent.\\n\\nComing to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas.\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Performance Review\\n\\nGalaxy M31\\n\\nThe Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions.\\n\\nOn the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company‚Äôs custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.',\n",
       " 'I bought the model with 8GB RAM and I must say I am amazed with the speed and performance of the phone. Great looks, sleek, sturdy, stylish, with an awesome display (SUPER AMOLED) that brings out the colours in vibrant hues. The fingerprint sensor is amazing and also the face unlock is nicely responsive. It has a powerful battery (6000 mAh) which runs quite long and has a fast charging 15W charger that fails to disappoint. 128 GB is more than sufficient for storage and the camera quality is decent but not great. Overall, a steal deal at this price and a must buy for people who are looking out for a Made in India phone.',\n",

       " \"It's a great phone to buy on Big sales or Deep discount sales days. The phone is definitely worth buying for 14k or less but not beyond that.

For 14k or below, just go for it..\\n\\nafter 3months of usage:\\nPhone is good, got android 11 update as well..\\nfew annoying things to be noted are\\n1) during calls, the hold or record button gets enabled when the ear touches the sides of the pannels.

What I do is, put the phone into home screen and lock the screen as soon as I attend the call or when my calls gets picked\\n\\n2) Bloatware - Too many bloatwares and Galaxy store updates apps of its liking. So I disbaled Galaxy store\\n\\n3) Power cord - the length of the cord is way less than cords provided by any other brands.

Exynos 9611 processor comes with Mali-G72 MP3 graphics which are able to handle gaming relatively well.\\n\\n3. It comes with Android 10.0 which is layered with Samsung's own OneUI.\\n\\n4.

It has polycarbonate back which isn‚Äôt as premium as a glass-back construction but does seem solid.\\n\\n7. The finger scanner is quick. It supports face unlock as well but it isn't fastest (Still does its job).\\n\\n8. With 6 GB ram, the performance is smooth. No issues so far. 128 GB storage is quite enough.\\n\\n9. It comes with a triple-slot i.e. dual sim option (4g+4g) and a memory card (You can expand up to 512 GB if need be).\\n\\n10. Pixel density is 403 ppi and resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels.\\n\\nCons:-\\n\\n1. Night mode isn‚Äôt the best.\\n\\n2.

The main 64MP clicks only in 3:4 aspect ration but it is really crisp.\\nAttached some sample shots.\\n\\nMacro lens surprised me! It is actually pretty useful and captures minute details, viole reproduction is also apt.\\n\\nWide angle camera: This one i felt just ok! It should be minimum 13MP to give justice to details.\\n\\nSelfie cam: 32MP is more than sufficient! Clicks beautiful images. There are many things which selfie lovers might like.\\n\\nVideo recording: stability is good. In low light it struggled little bit but overall no complaints. Hyperlapse and super slow modes are fun!\\n\\nSummary: If you want a mobile for your multimedia needs with long lasting battery, great display, fantastic cameras and Non China Brand you can trust this device!\\n\\n(Interestingly device came with Helo app preinstalled which is banned by govt.

       " 'My previous 3 smart phone were of different Xiomi models. After the recent Anti China sentiments like most of the Indian customwrs I was also desperately looking for a good smart phone not of Chinese origin. And yes Samsung Galaxy filled that requirement. This model Galaxy M31 is a good phone with a nice battery back up of 6000 mAH lasting for 2-3 days in normal use with fast charging capabilities. It has good quality quad camera with nice front camera. The finger print reader is very effective n prompt. It does not have unwanted forced inbuilt Apps which you can not remove unlike in Xiomi models. Also it has a dedicated SD card slot unlike the hybrid slot in Xiomi where you can either put second SIM or a card. The sound n picture quality is really good n clearly audible. With 6 GB RAM n 64 GB hard drive it can take care of all your processing n storage requirements. All these package will cost you about 15500 which is a good deal for a mid range smart phone with a Made in India tag. Go for it.',\n",

The camera quality is really good, and although I have only taken photos of my answer scripts so far, I am looking forward to taking more photos with it.

I had shortlisted Redmi9 pro max and this one as my top 2 choices for a 17000 or less phone. I opted for M31 for its 6000mah battery, oled screen and great camera. I am not a high end gamer but I do create a lot of memes, videos and posts for my social media. First 24 hours, this phone rocks (my last phone is a Moto G4 plus). No heating issues. Screen is too good. Battery after 24 hours of hectic usage is still 40% remaining. 15w charger is not ultra fast but quite decent. Overall a great purchase decision. I will replace my other MotoG5 plus with this soon. Instead of spending 30k on one phone, buy two at 15-16k each. This strategy has worked for me very well. What's most fascinating part about the last 24 hours is the Samsung app that moved some 28 GB of data files from my Moto in no time, effortlessly. This is huge.\\n\\nSo should you buy M31?

The POWER MODE especially is phenomenal .\\n3. 64Mp Camera is a beast when it comes to details but the 16MP ( pixel binning ) auto mode is the best where this device shines as the HDR and algorithms by samsung are just so perfect . No image over processing nothing . The Ultra Wide is the best as said by many top reviewers and it has distortion correction as well where as the Macro camera captures details and quality as it's a 5MP shooter .\\n4.

PUBG plays at HD and High frame rates by default and plays smoothly as well . That was a surprise to me also bcz I never thought of exynos handling games so good .\\n5.

       " \"The Box Contents :\\nThe Phone, Charger(15W), C-Type Charging-cum-usb Cable, Some Related Papers\\n\\nFirst Impressions :\\nThe Package was packed well and the Samsung Box was compact.\\nThe phone has a impresive design and the weight was well distributed.\\n\\nAfter a week usuge:\\n1. Display: As the Specification refers, it is sAMOLED. The brightness is well maintained even in bright sunlight you see the display pretty well. The viewing angles are also good. No color changes when views angles gets changed. No queries from my side.\\n\\n2. Body: The body is Plastic Back built with Gorilla Glass 3 protection at the front, the body felt a bit heavy as compared to other phones of this budget section( of course thanks to massive battery).\\n\\n3. SIM Tray: The sim tray has the 2+1 Sim and MicroSD slot.\\n\\n4. Front Camera: Performed well in Natural as well artificial lighting. Can see the detailed texture on the face(just turn off the Beauty effect) and the one of the main function is that during calls, front camera is used as ambient light sensor to turn off the screen. Some may find this not helpful it's all about the habbit that is to be developed with time.\\n\\n5. Speakers: Single speaker at the bottom right. I played musics of high frequency and bass, at high sound it losses it quality a bit but yes at 70-80% volume the sound was good and satisfying.\\nThe ear piece sound quality is exceptionally great.\\n\\n6. Rear Cameras: The design of Quad Cameras impressed me, on the top left it got a 5MP sensor and below that we got a 64MP main camera module and below that we have a 8MP wide-camera and on top right corner we got a 8MP wide angle-lens and below it we got a single LED flash.\\n\\nThe 64MP images are out the box. But you will notice the overall quality of normal 16MP photos are a bit rich as compared to 64MP photos as capturing image in 64MP and rendering it to 16MP increases it's quality.\\n\\nThe Live Focus is impressive and the blurring edge of the photos is great in natural light but found a bit low in artificial lighting. I am satisfied very well.\\n\\nThe wide camera Performed pretty well and got satisfactory results.\\n\\nI am bit disappointed with the Macro Lens that didn't performed well, however in multiple shots I got a good quality macro photo. But using main camera for macro photos gives great results.\\n\\nThe LED was pretty good but it can be a bit more brighter but who cares, when it has a 64MP camera with night mode. Yes the night mode is exceptionally well.\\n\\n7. Battery: Yes the massive 6000mAH battery is worth called massive. I got the screen-on period of 10hours in a single charge. On using it in a average way gave me around 30 hours of backup.\\n\\n8. Performance: I experienced buttery smooth performance in using it in above average usage. But I will say that you can get a bit lags in heavy task like playing heavy games. Yeah, you will not get that performance as it doesn't got a gaming processor.\\nBut in daily routine jobs you can depend on it always you will never get a lag.\\n\\nThe only visible difference between M30s and M31 is that the Camera Module area is 2MM wider in M31 and the placement of secondary mic. is in top left in case of M31 and which is on the right in M30s\\n\\nAs a average user 60Hz display is okay for me, I didn't experienced any frame drops.\\n\\nOverall the phone is pretty impressive and will never let you down in day to day task but for gaming you will face some issues like a bit heating, frame drops at high settings.\\n\\nI will reccomend this product for average users. This phone performed well in medium setting in gaming and has a good AI in camera. It is good for photography and this 6GB/128GB black version is just out of the box.\",\n",
       " \"Bought this during the lockdown as my current phone was having issues. Read a few online reviews and watched couple of you tube review videos before taking the plunge. Well not disappointed so far.\\n\\nPros:\\na) The screen is big and crisp in picture quality. The colors are vivid although I changed it to natural via settings as in vivid they were too bright sometimes. But that's a personal preference.\\nb) Battery life is good. Gives atleast 6-7 hours of SOT and will vary upon usage.\\nc) Having a dedicated microSD slot is a advantage when you have two sims to use.\\nd) The fingerprint sensor is pretty snappy in response. Haven't tried the face unlock feature yet.\\ne) Speaker output is good and can be heard pretty easily. Although would have preferred a stereo setup.\\n\\nCons:\\na) Bit on the heavier side but can be expected due to the huge battery. Although well balanced.\\nb) The processor although snappy seems a bit laggy during couple of app transitions. maybe the software can be tweaked to fix this.\\nc) Not a gaming monster but recent games can be played at lower-mid quality depending on the title.\\nd) Samsung bloatware need to uninstalled....not a big fan of so many unnecessary notifications from them.\\n\\nFor the deal price of 17K for the 8GB variant, it was a value for money purchase and definitely a good buy. Kudos to seller and Amazon for the prompt delivery the next day.\",\n",
       " \"I mainly got samsung for its battery life.. usually I'm comfortable with Nokia for its battery life and rough handling..and previously I had Nokia sirocco.. this time I was considering poco and samsung m 31.. it's a good budget phone with very good battery life.. I use it for watching videos and it comes for 2 days.. camera quality is good for me, though not like nokia 8 ,but good enough for the price..I don't take selfies.. I've put the phone down from hip level 3 times accidentally and it has not broken so far.. better to have a flip cover for protection.. so my overall experience is very good as I got it after reading a lot of specifications.. I don't play games so I don't know about that.. why I didn't choose poco or redme was coz of the ads and battery life..hope it helps..\",\n",

Watching videos is a delightful experience\\n2. Quad camera and selfie camera are very good. Low light photos in night mode are excellent with the 64MP main camera\\n3. Fingerprint sensor is very accurate and fast\\n4. Apps load quickly as expecte\\nB. Cons\\n1. Battery life is not as expected from 6000 mAH massive battery. Lasts about one and half days with normal use. Few phones with smaller batteries last for same time.\\n2.charging the battery fully takes a very long time (about 2 hrs 15 mins from 15% to 100%) inspite of \"fast charging\", which is very disappointing.\\nOverall the phone is very good and highly recommended.',\n",
       " 'Bought the M31 around 2 weeks back. Extremely satisfied with the perfomance.\\nBattery life is amazing, getting more than 1 full day with extra-heavy usage (usually my phones last half a day on a heavy use day). With moderate usage, it can go up to 2 days on a full charge. Video edits, image edits, hours on Facebook and whatsapp, around 2 hours of calling per day. Camera is outstanding with sunlight and in medium light conditions. In very low light, the camera is average, but definitely not bad. Macro shots are amazing. 64mp option for images create crystal clear images of upto 20-25 mb size!!. There has been no lag whatsoever with multiple heavy app usage yet. Fingerprint reader is superfast and has taken more than one try to unlock only a couple of times so far, that too when my finger was moist. Build quality seems really good, i use the phones with care, but my activities are usually rough, and this phone hasnt failed. Amoled is amazing. I am using an amoled screen for the first time, and it is truly stunning. Actually its been a long time since i have been looking for all the options that M31 has offered, and very few other phones have all these (6000 mah battery, amoled screen, stunning camera with slow motion and superslow motion)packed into one, and that too at a really attractive price.',\n",

Night shot are extremely well colored and aren't dull.\\n\\nProcessor - the exynos 9611\\nSimply put it resembles 675AIE in performance than the 722 AIE. So, that's one factor you need to consider.\\nWhat does it mean?\\nIt means playing PubG in ultra graphics will be a problem. Just that, at the extreme frame rate the phone will not be able to do it.\\nNote:only at extreme frame rate dies the phone sort of fails.\\n\\nFor everything else the maximum RAM usage is 4.2 and then under device care ckean your RAM. Also set the time to automatically clean your phone.\\n\\nSamsung UI is extremely good. It resembles stock android and the bloat ware is not annoying.\\n\\nScreen is next level. sAMOLED screen does its job.\",\n",

For those looking to not give their money to the Chinese who are using the money to attack our country, among the Non-Chinese smartphones, the M31 presented the most bang-for-buck on paper.\\n\\nThe M31 really good in every department, including in its massive 6k mAh battety, its AMOLED display, Android 10 OS, 6GB of RAM, 128GB ROM, Samsung's slick UI.\\n\\nAt the sub 20K price range, the phone is an excellent buy.\\n\\nFor photographers though not so much since it does not fully support CAM2API. Photographers can snag the Asus 6z, for its throw away price of 28k. The 6z supports shooting in RAW as well, unlike the Samsung M31.\\n\\nFor the regular Joe though, the Samsung Galaxy M31 is a pocket friendly Non-Chinese phone option that is compelling.\\n\\nAmazon's delivered 1 day ahead of schedule.\",\n",

( Samsung have to focus on speakers\\nstill on these models) 3 / 5\\nNo Fast charging support ( it takes 2.5 - 3 hours for full charge) 3 / 5\\nDesign/Build - 3.5 / 5\\nOverall, have to say tremendous improvement in their SAMSUNG products and giving very tough competition to other flagship models.\\nOf course great thanks to Seller and amazon as usual for sending this..hassle free process.',\n",
       " \"All are good but I don't think that 6000mah battery works like 6000mah ...battery life not up to the mark what I have desired ...samsung engineers must work on it .otherwise all things are perfect..compared to the price but those who say that 6000 mah battery goes for two days they are wrong it works max 12 hrs on screen continuously but if u are not a hardcore user it works 1 day full. Those gyz who says in you tube that it works 1 and half day or two days ..that does not perfectly match with the reality.\\nOne more think charging time is very high u need 3 hrs to recharge it from zero to 100%. I don't have problem with the charging time but those who have problem with the charging time they may shift to a better option.\",\n",

Just take my word for it. When I bought this phone, I read these reviews, and I was like wow these people probably don't know what they're talking about, but yeah it was a late realisation. And of you're a serious photographer, then forgot about this phone. The camera has no pro mode features. It doesn't have manual focus, or shutter speed . Night mode is so gross you're never going to want to use it. The battery was supposed to be amazing, its not. Its just good. Like a 4500 mah battery. If you're looking for a great UI, then I'll have to get your hopes down again. This is not one UI, it on UI core. Which is basically one UI stripped of all it's cool features. Some great alternatives are : Samsung m31s (if you really want Samsung) realme 6, redmi not 9, Poco x2, and Motorola one fusion. You can trust me here I have a lot of smartphone experience...\",\n",

Having 6000mAh, it lasts for 1 complete day which is good, I liked it. But I thought it will last more longer, but since it has sampled display and 6GB Ram and super fast processor, it takes probably more power. But battery performance will not disappoint you, I used this mobile for Internet surfing, video calls, Netflix and YouTube and it was pretty good. Charging takes time because it has a huge battery in it, so it will take around 3 hours to fully charge it.\\nPerformance -\\nOver all, the mobile's performance is really fast with Samsung's own processor and 6gb Ram you will not feel any lag while using this phone and it has latest Android and security patch level so you will always enjoy while using so many apps in the background.\\n\\nOverall summary -\\nIn this budget you are getting the features of a 20 to 25 k mobile and Samsung is a reliable brand you can trust on. It's made in India mobile so you can definitely use this mobile without any hassle so go to amazon Amazon Samsung website, buy your mobile, start using it and enjoy!\",\n",

Battery life is super and working two days in a single charge with heavy usage.\\n3. Camera quality as compared to OnePlus 7 is comparable but OnePlus7 is the winner but considers the cost of OnePlus 7. Overall pictures quality is good.\\n4. Call quality is also good but the speakers are at the bottom so if you're watching videos without headphones, you will struggle with sound as you're fingers might cover the speakers.\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Battery charging is slow and i think this is due to the fact that battery is 6000 MAH. It takes 4 hours to charge fully.\\n2. It's not coming with a default screen protector so you need to buy it separately and i did not find the good screen protector so far for this phone.\\n\\nOverall this is a fantastic phone with all the good things about it so go for it.

But u can't use flash in 64 mp setting. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock do its job well. Fast charge takes 2 and half hr to full charge from 10%. But I prefer more slow charger as that will increase battery life. And remember it has non removable battery. So why to worry if it takes 4 hrs to full charge. Overall go for it without thinking for alternate.\\n\\nBut one problem, seller didn't supply ejection pin with the mobile. I don't want to return as mobile is superb.

You've got a lot of features that you'd get on expensive phones like the A series and I've only mentioned what I love the most here. Go for the M31 for the Quad cam and the monster battery life.

I have not played very heavy games on it except once I played a 3.5gb role playing game and it was still working fluid. Front camera is also very good and captures really clear pics. Macro camera is also nice. I charge this phone once and use for almost one and a half day without trouble. It's a bit heavy than recent smartphone but it's because its battery is jumbo but the weight is evenly distributed and once in use..... you will never find it a problem.

As i use it only for calls and browsing and normal regular use like watching movies, YouTube...it gives a decent battery support and lasts upto 1 and a half day. Not suitable for gaming purpose.

       " \"After 1 month usage, here is my review.\\n\\nI had been using Moto for years now but got fed up with not up to date build quality and poor performance. I am also not comfortable with UI that is far from stock android, so didnt give the chinese phones a look. So M31 was my best option.\\n\\nSamsung One UI with Android 10 is an absolute pleasure to navigate.\\n6GB RAM is more than enough with 3.5 GB always available without any apps open.\\nIt multi tasks with ease.\\nScreen is AMOLED Full HD and it completely blew your mind as a first time AMOLED user. The difference between AMOLED and normal screen is astounding. Once you get used to it, you won't be able to go back to normal screen. Best Display on a budget phone hands down.\\nI was discouraged by other reviews saying Exynos processor is not good. However I have had no problems with it. Ofcourse if you compare its benchmarks with Snapdragon, it falls behind but that does not make it a bad processor. But trust me, looking at it alone, it is good with no problems. I haven't encountered any stutter or lag till now. Even gaming like Call of Duty and PUBG is perfect with medium settings. Ultra high drops some frames but that is expected of a budget phone. And anyway, gaming experience is perfectly fine on medium settings.\\nHaven't yet tested camera with the lockdown going on but for normal user like me, I found it to be of good quality.\\nBattery is a behemoth and easily lasts 1.5 days with normal usage. with 1-2 hours gaming, I need to charge it only once every morning.\\nBecause of battery its slightly on the heavy side but you wont notice because weight distribution is excellent. Feels extremely nice to hold. I strongly recommend getting a cover as the back is glossy and picks up a ton of smudges. That's the only con I experienced.\\n\\nHaving used Moto G series and Moto X series in the past, I can safely say this is the best budget smartphone I have brought till date. Phones with specs like this used to cost 30-40k 2 years back. Absolute steal.\",\n",
       " \"First of all, I consider this phone to be excellent value for money due to\\nhigh storage capacity, security functions and the quality of the camera. For me, the specs are as good\\nI would expect from much more expensive phones. Another reason is that it is small enough to carry in a pocket. I'm not keen\\nthe large screen phones.\",\n",
       " 'This is my first attempt with Samsung as my alternative phone number. I am a dedicated & loyal iPhone user since beginning but I can confidently say that it was definitely a very good buy. Excellent features, no way behind Apple, great look, back side finger sensor is of great help to easy opening of screen lock. I took some photos , same frames both with my iPhone 11 & Samsung M31. I can definitely say Samsung captured much better snaps in terms of depth, vividness, colour & clarity. Last but not the least , value for money. I must highly recommend.',\n",
       " \"Pros:\\nAmazing Screen Quality\\nOne UI\\nSamsung branding and service\\nMacro Photography\\n\\nCons:\\nDespite 6000mAh, I did not find it to be great. It was just good.\\nComing from an iPhone, I felt android phones' are way behind in Image processing techniques. Realized that pixel MP values are just to lure people and the real power of a camera lies in the Image processing.\\n\\nRest everything is normal like every other phone.\\n\\nIf you want to buy a Samsung 4GB RAM phone and macro photography doesn't matter for you, go for the M21. But If you are going for a 6GB phone, I would recommend you to spend those extra Rupees and get this M31.\",\n",

I used to have connectivity issues with my previous phone, which was a big botheration. There are only areas that I have a bit of a concern. 1. the width of the phone is a bit narrow which, because of my thick fingers creates some typing challenges. 2. I wish the charging cable was 0.5 meter longer.\\n\\nOverall a good phone.',\n",

It gets 15W fast charge which takes almost 3 hours to charge this power house from less than 10% to full charge.\\n- Camera: quad camera setup does it job well. 64MP Primary camera takes decent photos in day light. Live focus also works great. Macro is fine too. Ultra wide mode is also good. Though it has night mode but shows noise. 32 MP front camera is best in this segment.\\nProcessor: Exynox 9611 works absolutely fine for day to day life. I'm not a gamer so not sure about gaming performance. Apps open without any issue and don't feel any lag.\\nUI: One UI also gives the best experience. It is very smooth and easy to use.\\nThe other good thing about this phone is that Samsung is providing McAfee security in this phone which no one will find in Chinese phones.\\nSo if you have the budget of 17-18k for new smart phone and want to get smooth and best experience in this price range, please go ahead and buy this phone. But if you less budget around 14k the go for Galaxy M21 in which one will get tri camera setup instead of quad in M31 and have 64GB internal memory which should also be sufficient and rest of the features list are same as M31.\",\n",

If you have more money, go for a higher priced phone like A70s. This phone has the features of other phones which are in the price bracket of 18k-22k.\\n\\n2. The battery backup is very good, my phone lasts 3 days on a single charge, with WiFi on all day, 2-3 hours of browsing throughout the day and moderate calling of 1-2 hours per day. However, if you want to exploit the phone by playing games all day long, you have to charge the phone everyday. Games run smooth, but this is not a gaming phone. You should target something in the price bracket of 35k+ for that purpose.\\n\\n3. Phone is sturdy and looks great. Drop it from a height of 2 feet and it will be okay. Spray water on it, and still it will be ok.\\n\\n4. Camera is really good for normal photography including slow mo, fast shutter speed, good colour reproduction, and daytime photography. Night time photography is decent, but don't expect it to perform like a 50k phone. It will produce photos like a 20k phone should.\\n\\n5. Charging time is around 2.5 hours if you are on 0% charge. But it charges very fast to 85%. So, if you start charging it from 40%, it will take around 30-45 minutes to get fully charged.\\n\\n6. Phone does not get hot under any circumstances, does not hand, does not restart.\\n\\n7. Phone display is very bright, even in bright sunlight.\\n\\n8.

So applying a tampered glass is necessary.\\n3. The front camera performs very poor in low light\\n4.

Guys the first u will notice is its display and its amazing its the best u can get under 20k 60hz amoled is way better than 120 or 90 hz ips lcd panels in realme poco etc the display is equivalent to the one on oneplus 7 so it gives a flagship experience it looks better than punch hole ips lcd displays.\\n2. Camera is just amazing dont look at the reviews on you tube cuz the 64 mp sensor is almost same on every device so u can just edit the images and adjust white bala ce exposure etc and get the same images on all the devices\\nIn the competition\\n3. Software experience: Trust me guys the software experience on samsung is at next level and u will feel it only when u use it by yourself whether its the music application or even the alarm theme or its the themes collection or the user interface it gives u the flagship level experience and u wont feel u are using a midrange phone as one ui on samsung is highly customizable. Talking about the performance believe me u wont find a bit of difference in real life usage between the snapdragon and exynos 9611 it gives a lag free experience as the one ui 2 is highly optimized and pubg runs on highest setting which u can't run on snapdragon 720g equipped smartphones.\\nIf u are planning to buy this smartphone just go for it its better than the competition\",\n",

I'm actually very impressed by the price to perfomance ratio of this device. The biggest USP of this phone is its OS. Samsung's OneUI 2.0 has improved tremendously in reducing bloatware and managing RAM efficiently. It multitasks with ease. The battery life is fantastic. I'm putting my device to charge every alternate day, the screen on time is at least 9-11 hours depending on the intensity of the usage. The Camera quality is great, not outstanding. The speaker is loud and clear. It has Dolby Atmos audio drivers for external audio devices. The call clarity is excellent from both ends. The rear camera does a great job but the front camera doesn't live up to the expectations. It smoothens the images taken from the front cam, not sure if it's because of the sensor or if its in the software. Since it's a budget phone I don't think it would be fair to expect a lot. I'm not much of a mobile gamer so I never actually tested it in that aspect. The overall build quality is good, looks premium but the entire body is made of plastic. It nearly takes 150 mins to charge to a 100% with the 15W factory charger. The speed doesn't change even if you use a charger of higher capacity. Coming to the conclusion, I feel this is the best budget phone considering the price and brand value of Samsung. It does its job perfectly and I'll definitely recommend this phone.\",\n",

The screen.\\nsAMOLED display is on point, super clear & very well user friendly.\\n2. The camera.\\nStunning. 64mp does the job the way it's supposed to. Front 32mp camrea is also very impressive. In the rear, quad camera setup is impressive. The sample images are a few example of the camera quality. Also the wide angle lens is a rather wonderful function.\\n3. The battery.\\nProbably the biggest highlight of this smartphone is the battery. A MASSIVE 6000mAh battery can easily go on throughout the day with enough battery life left for the next day. For an average user, the battery will easily live upto 2 days. Heavy usage? It will still go on for a day. Even when the battery is about 15 to 20% the performance doesnt show any decline. The only thing i found a bit not so good about the phone is the charger. M31 comes with a 15W charger which will take atleastaround 2.3 hrs to charge fully. But the new M31s fixes the problem, it comes with a 25W charger & the same 6000mAh battery promising shorter charging time.\\n4. Built quality & design.\\nFront and rear looks impressive. Has a very modern yet conservative designs. Doesn't feel that heavy while holding and is also a perfect fit in the pocket.\\nThe blue colour looks beautiful but the one i have is a black one. Yes, the black looks cooler but since the rear is made up of plastic with a glossy finish, it can very easily attaract scratches and fingerprints, so I'd suggestanyone to use it with a mobile cover.\\n5. Verdict.\\nOverall the smartphone is an impressive package. It simply proves that spending over 50k on a smartphone is insane. Some complain about the processor that is Exynos 9611 which is in my point of view nothing to be worried about. Every function runs smooth and easy thanks to the processor and 6gb RAM, touchscreen is also very responsive, also the power button can be used to open apps as a shortcut. With 128gb space, dual sim support, 6gb ram, a great battery life, sAmoled display, this phone has everything that it takes to be a flagship phone competitor as a considerable margin. Its almost been more than 2 months since im using this phone and so far i haven't faced any problems with the device any hopefully will not face any in the coming future. The surprising thing is that with all the power packed in the box, it still manages to fit under 20k category which makes it incredibly appealing. I'd surely suggest if anyone is looking to buy one!\",\n",
       " \"Samsung rolled out a beauty in the under 20k price range in m31. A completely all round phone which feels good in hand and runs smooth\\nBattery: 5/5 6000mah, what else do you expect\\nScreen: 6/5 SAmoled has my heart and soul and I dare you to find a better screen.\\nDesign: 3.5 A little too thick but I guess it's compromisable given the battery is huge. Also the body could be metal or glass but since looks are subjective this phone looks pretty decent\\nCamera: 4.5/5 A beautiful camera system which works like a charm in daylight as well as night. To some the pictures may appear grainy but that's because of the resolution and efficiency of the screen itself. -.5 due to the limitations on the 64mp cam\\nProcessor:4/5 Exynos run systems never compare to their Snapdragon equivalents but 9611 is pretty decent. After playing high Res games I couldn't see any lags or issues so in conclusion it's not as bad as it is made to sound.\\nOS: 4/5 the new OS by Samsung is definitely an improvement from their last few versions. But they definitely aren't stock android. Some preinstalled apps are definitely a pain but uninstalling takes matter of seconds. Plus Samsung's security system is A+ and keeps your device safe and also allows data transfer for faster recovery.\\n\\nBrownie points for having a designated audio jack instead of the type c and also a designated fingerprint sensor over the in screen fingerprint sensor which are always slower.\\n\\nThe phone leaves barely anything to be asked except for maybe an ir blaster, although it may or may not be required by many it does come in handy at times.\\n\\nOverall: 4.5/5 it's a two horse race for the under 20k segment between Samsungand realme. If you want a phone for general use and a battery powerhouse Samsung m31 seems to be the one.\",\n",

       " 'The Galaxy M31 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M30s, Galaxy A50s, and Galaxy A51. It‚Äôs the processor choice for Samsung‚Äôs budget and lower mid-range phones, and all I can say is that it gets the job done in day-to-day use.\\nThe Galaxy M30s had the new Exynos 9611 processor under the hood, a 48MP triple camera setup at the back, and a beautiful 6.4-inch Super AMOLED panel up front. In fact, Samsung told us at the Galaxy M31 launch that the camera, battery life, and display are the most important factors for young people nowadays, and those are the parameters it focused on when designing the Galaxy M31.\\nThe Galaxy M31 has a polycarbonate body that‚Äôs pretty much the same as the Galaxy M30s. Since there‚Äôs a 6,000 mAh battery inside, the M31 is heavy, but not so heavy that it would turn you off. However, the phone doesn‚Äôt feel very premium to hold, and that might not be to everyone‚Äôs liking despite the rather affordable price tag. The design is quite utilitarian, in short, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preferences.\\n\\nAt the back, the quad camera setup is housed inside a rectangular window in the upper left corner, with the words ‚Äô64 megapixels‚Äô mentioned next to the LED flash. It may come off as cheap to some, but in my opinion the font used for the text makes it look quite stylish. There‚Äôs also a capacitive fingerprint sensor next to the cameras, which I still think is the best solution for fingerprint recognition on phones\\nThe ultra-wide camera on the M31 is an 8-megapixel sensor like the M30s‚Äô ultra-wide camera. It‚Äôs useful to capture a wider scene, but don‚Äôt expect to see any fine detail when you zoom in, especially at night. As for the 5MP macro camera, it‚Äôs great if you love taking close-up shots, though it‚Äôs often difficult to understand exactly when the object is in focus, resulting in a few out-of-focus shots.\\n\\nHere are a few samples from the rear cameras, including ultra-wide and macro shots',\n",

Use back cover.\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Slow charging due to 15w but this is not a problem as 1 time charge will last you while day\\n2. Some times the apps icons on up swipe do not display, once locked and unlocked it reappears not much of an issue must be software or due to heavy graphics wall papers.

       " \"This is my 3rd phone in Galaxy series. Galaxy series from Samsung is widely known for great phones with great features, but this one M31, is great even from Budget point of view. I did purchase on First Day First Show, when this was launched. Reason is number of reviews I had read on YouTube. Almost 20+ reviews I checked. I also read number of issues on Samsung forum / various blogs/forum etc. Every piece of information convinced, this is the best phone in this budget. Extreme value for Money.\\n\\nMy smartphone journey has been quiet diverse in terms of various companies, so I am able to compare / differentiate various features, with hands on experience.\\n\\nFrom Year 2012 : Samsung Galaxy S2 > HTC Incredible 2 > HTC Rhyme > Samsung Galaxy Note 2 > LG G Vista > LG G6 > Redmi Note 3 > LG Q6 > Redmi Pro 6 > Samsung M31 : To year 2020.\\n\\nFollowing is my experience with M31, after a month of usage.\\n\\nGood: (for M31)\\n\\n- Android 10! Great looking version & beautifully customized by Samsung. Even in 10th edition, Samsung was fast to roll out update.\\n- Mammoth display, my kids can actually use it properly for school online classes, as screen is sufficient when viewed from near distance.\\n- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.\\n- 6000 mAh battery is NEED of the times, with so much dependence on online activities. I use it full day + almost half of the time on HOT spot. Still, battery works for a 1.5 to 2 days. Charging is very fast, but not ultra fast. 30 min can increase around 50% battery.\\n- Both the SIM support 4G (that‚Äôs plus), as we can practically use 2 JIO SIM for almost double the data, without any switchover.\\n- Separate SD Card (up to 512 GB), actually is a great feature. Existing memory of 128 GB is sufficient as of now & SD cards (high capacity) are not cheap as such. So, Samsung did a right thing to provide enough memory from beginning.\\n- Mobile speakers is good for normal music (less bass) & conference call. You actually feel part of the room, when conference call over speaker.\\n- Camera is really good. So many features re there & I am yet to fully know them, as my basic usage is not for photography, but my children makes great video from this phone.\\n- Figure-print sensor response is good, but when finger is moist due to sweat / water, it doesn‚Äôt response. That‚Äôs problem with all the phone, but the moment you wipe your finger, you are good to go. Response time is ultra fast.\\n- Thanks Amazon for delivering within 3 days, even in partial lock down conditions.\\n\\nNot So Good: (for M31)\\n\\n- Not thin & light. Additionally, I have put up a sturdy cover + glass, so weight increased heavily. After few days you get used to it.\\n- Doesn‚Äôt come with Samsung Security feature (like other galaxy series premium phone). However, Samsung does offer S-Secure app to lock certain apps with finger scan.\\n- To many Samsung related apps (like global goal etc) & many of them are still to be known what it does. But Samsung can reduce such apps to save memory. You can disable few of them.\\n- SMS can‚Äôt be deleted with a swipe (like in case of redmi),that‚Äôs important as many of the OTP/temporary messages should be deleted to reduce clutter.\\n- Mobile torch can‚Äôt be switched of with a phone power button. This is a required feature, instead of going to notification & switch off torch.-\\n- No light sensor in front, as it helps to avoid call going in hold during conversation. I read on Samsung forum, that front camera is used, so we have to hold phone in particular normal angle, that will ensure that call doesn‚Äôt get disturbed. Now, little used to it.\\n- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it. Apps run like butter & it never gives a message of storage space running out, in spite of heavy storage.\\n- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a sub 20k feature rich phone, go for M31/Samsung. As it is far batter than any other Chinese options available, which are good in flashy advertisement, but in long run performance, they can‚Äôt match Samsung. I have been user of\",\n",

The only con is the front camera could have been a 'pin-hole' form factor but then one easily gets used to the 'U-cut' camera form-factor in a matter of a few days.\\n\\nOverall a must have device and highly recommended on all fronts - good camera / display / processing / battery / looks.\",\n",

The truth that I am quite happy with the purchase, current games are going quite well, there is no slowness or anything. The camera even in low light conditions goes quite well for night mode, the rear 64MP camera takes pictures with quite a bit of quality, and the 32MP front one also has good quality, very good pictures are taken with this smartphone.

       " 'I\\'m writing this review after using the phone for a month, and here\\'s the detailed review of my experience using the phone.\\n\\n‚Ä¢ BEST PARTS\\n\\n1) SCREEN: Straight up the most attractive part of the phone. The sAMOLED display is crisp, color accurate and legible even in the hardest of lights. And the Always-On Display is a bliss, with customisable clock faces and even options to place own photos. Since the display is AMOLED, this doesn\\'t cause much battery drain (about 1-2% more drain when keeping it \"Always On\" as compared to off). And the bezels are not noticeable much, and the screen is super smooth. The refresh rate is still 60Hz, but then it\\'s not geared towards gaming. 9/10\\n\\n2) BATTERY LIFE: Absolutely unbelievable! The 6000 mAh battery is no joke and it delivers. I use my phone heavily (~10hr screen on time, with video calls, gaming and instagram scrolling) and still the battery lasts me a day and a half. Charging is also good, it takes almost 2.5 hours to get it from ~20% to 100%. 10/10\\n\\n3) PERFORMANCE: The 6/64 variant caters to my needs perfectly. There is always more than 2 GB of RAM free, even when there\\'s 4-5 background apps open. Sometimes I minimise my game to respond to a notification, and then forget about it; and when I open it after 6 hours it\\'s still there in the memory. Phenomenal!\\nThe processor, now. Before buying the phone, I read a lot of reviews as I was skeptical about the processor. Snapdragon 730G is better, they said. But to be honest, I really don\\'t see the difference. This phone has never once lagged in my one month of using it. It is snappy and DOESN\\'T HEAT UP. 10/10\\n\\n4) SOFTWARE: As soon as I started up the phone, I opened up the app drawer and removed all the apps that could be removed, and then disabled some I didn\\'t need and couldn\\'t be uninstalled (Samsung\\'s mostly), so that\\'s GREAT. Also, I ensured I disabled notifications whenever any spammy notifications arrived, and within two days my phone was ABSOLUTELY bloat-free.\\nSamsung\\'s OneUI is beautiful. I have no other words for it. The dark mode goes well with the sAMOLED display, and is absolutely great to work with. I\\'d always been a fan of stock Android and Pixel, but OneUI changed me. 10/10\\n\\n5) CAMERA QUALITY: I\\'m not an enthusiastic photographer, but as far as day-to-day photography is concerned, it is magnificent and highly detailed. You need to tweak settings in the Camera app to suit your taste and also set the resolution (64MP photos are 3:4 aspect ratio, but I prefer Full screen, for example). I also got GCam installed and that\\'s added benefit, if you care. The wide angle lens is nice! There\\'s barrell distortion at the edges but you get an option to automatically correct it in the settings. Macro camera is able to pick up details easily and really close to the subject.\\nFront camera is equally good, able to capture details nicely. There\\'s also a wide angle mode for the front camera, though it\\'s just software and there isn\\'t an actual wide angle camera at the front. 9/10 for both!\\n\\n‚Ä¢ NOT-SO-GOOD PARTS\\n\\n1) The speaker quality is not breathtaking. It does the job and is reasonably loud, but I prefer headphones or else my Echo Dot for audio, so it doesn\\'t matter.\\n\\n2) The back surface is \"glasstic\" and smudges easily. Get yourself a cover and you\\'re good to go.\\n\\n3) Fingerprint sensor is FAST but use it once with sweaty fingers and it can\\'t detect anymore unless you clean it.\\n\\nSo, there you have it. If you want a no-nonsense phone with great battery, screen and camera, with NO ads (read: Xiaomi, Realme) and NO bloatware and a BEAUTIFUL UI, look no further. The Galaxy M31 is THE phone to go for.\\n\\nP.S. call quality and network is also flawless. I use airtel.',\n",

       " \"with plenty of very good and expert reviews available for Samsung M31 for its deserving features and quality, I would like to share my experience as a user with vision impairment using screen-reader and Text-to-speech:\\n1. Samsung mM31 features Samsung's own built-in screen reader 'voice assistant', hence Android Accessibility Suite doesn't come built-in. One needs to download it from playstore if the need be.\\n2. Samsung's 'Voice Assistant' is an efficient screen-reader in itself, but those used to Talkback will find it less suitable in terms of gestures and other features.\\n3. The camera is surprisingly accessible with the screen-reader telling you if face(s) get focused. I could click not-so-bad pictures as a totally blind person!\\n4. Samsung's UI and in-built applications offer smooth and faster navigation while using screen-reader. Most of the buttons in Samsung's apps are labeled and hence accessible.\\n5. Attending calls is most convenient with the volume-up button doing the job. Live caption is also another fantastic feature that will be useful for the hearing impaired people.\\n6. There could have been an option to wake the Google Assistant using power button since 'Okay Google' comment is not all that convenient in travel and noisy places.\\n\\nOverall, Samsung M31 is a very good choice in this budget for the visually impaired / blind users too.\",\n",

       " 'I have ordered this mobile on 20/07/2020 and got delivery on time i.e. 24/07/2020. I have chosen M31, 8 Gb RAM version. Earlier I have used Motorola mobiles (which are good and rugged one) and this is my first Samsung mobile and I think I have made a good decision. Rest time will tell in long term use but first impression is great.\\nSo list of Positive points:\\n1. Battery is very of good rating 6000 mAh. i do cycle rides using strava which uses GPS continually and to my surprise after using strava app for nearly 5 and half hour which include clicking photos dropped battery level from 100 % to 75% only. Which I think is very genuine.\\n\\n2. Processor is fast and efficient with almost no lag.\\n\\n3. Camera is definitely a plus point of this mobile. It will not disappoint you.\\n\\n4. RAM size is good as per today‚Äôs usage and I have opted for 8 Gb RAM so that in future after updates no issue arises. Other wise 6 Gb is also fine if you are going out of budget. (Here I want to mention that I am not a mobile gamer)\\n\\n5. Super amoled screen by Samsung is just awesome.\\n\\n6. User interface is very good with many good options and it will enhance core android experience. You can uninstall or hide default apps that you do not like on your mobile.\\n\\n7. Internal Memory is enough i.e. 128 Gb over that you get a dedicated micro SD card slot so that is impressive.\\n\\n8. Finger print sensor works very fast and efficiently.\\n\\nNow coming to negative points from my point of view\\n\\n1. Volume of loud speaker is bit less. If finger or something else comes over speaker it reduces volume drastically.\\n\\nOne neutral point is that it comes with a battery charger of 15 watts only which is bit low for 6000 mAh battery but at same time very fast charging is not good for life of battery. May be Samsung engineers did what is best for their product.\\n\\nFinal words \"It‚Äôs a good mid range mobile by Samsung with impressive performance‚Äù',\n",

No compromises there on the humongous 6000 all day long or should I say all 2 days long battery.

And the camera is no slouch the quad cam setup comes up with the best of modes. So when you go online with your pictures you don't feel bad at all. Camera has been done rightly. When you can watch Netflix in Full HD there are not a lot of phones providing this option in this segment.\",\n",

It takes some 2 and half hours to charge this monster battery, this should have been supported with a 25V fast charger)\\n\\nBody - 3.5 on 5 (Look and feel of the phone is quite premium, though nothing special in it. The glossy back lets the phone down as the back is quite slippery and prone to scratches and finger prints. Must buy a good back cover to protect the phone from slipping from hand)\\n\\nPerformance - 4.5 on 5 (The phone is quite good in performance as the UI is very smooth and there are no noticeable lags while using it. I have some 70-80 apps on the phone and the phone runs smoothly. With graphics intense gaming such as Asphalt or NFS No limits phone tends to heat a little bit.)\\n\\nIs it worth buying?

Incase you are someone who changes a phone once in 2.5 - 3 yrs, I would suggest you pick an 8gb RAM. I see that mostly 5 gb of RAM is consumed and we better be future proof , atleast for a 3 yr horixon. A 9611 processor with 8gb RAM should be abld to handle processing capacity required til 2023. Battery full charge to 10% discharge took 38 hrs twice - including few hrs of video watching, chrome usage, extensive calls in Google Meet and Teams, hours of dealhunt in Amazon and Flipkart etc.',\n",

Talking about the camera, it‚Äôs quite good although the night mode can get better but it‚Äôs still okay considering such type of product in such low price. The only limitation was the speakers as talking about samsung‚Äôs product it could have been better but to cover it up they are providing dolby atmos so it actually makes it up. Now about the game performance, oh it‚Äôs superb and quite good and maybe best in such price range as it has its own processor which is quite good I think and it comes in the 6gb and 8gb variant so depending on your needs. Talking about the fingerprint sensors, it‚Äôs fast and easy to use as it‚Äôs on the back but at day I use face unlock as it‚Äôs more handy and also fast. And it‚Äôs basically best for binge watching and gaming. All in all, in nutshell, I would say that it‚Äôs the best phone currently in such price range so you can buy it for sure.',\n",

About the OLED screen: I can adjust the color saturation, I have reduced the color saturation as I am not that used to vivid OLED displays. Brightness is pretty decent one good feature is that we can reduce the brightness to a lower level such that I don't want to install any 'Dark mode' application for night use.\\n2. Camera: Camera is pretty good, the wide-angle view is pretty handy when we don't have much space in the room. The front camera is also pretty decent on low light(Recommended).\\n3. Weight: It is pretty heavy as it has a massive 6000mah battery. However, the weight is balanced so it is nice to hold on, we won't feel it too heavy when we hold it for a long time.\\n4. Performance: Performance is a said as in the paper, I have tried Call of Duty and worked in medium graphics well.\\n5.Bluetooth: Bluetooth is important for me as I usually take calls with my Voyager Wireless headphones. Connection time is extremely low . I could turn on my headphone while phone is ringing and the next second the headphone is connected. I used to wait/need to manually connect on my old Zenfone max. So this is a great value add for me\\nNB: This is not a dedicated gaming phone.\\nTo conclude with this is a very good phone for people who travel a lot and watch movies , surf internet, attend online meetings during their travel. This is not the phone for gamers\",\n",

Go on and check those amazing pictures of the River Brahmaputra, Assam. Stunning, isn't it? Want to go for a tour and record amazing videos ? Do not even worry of battery backup.

       " \"The Samsung Galaxy M series has gained a lot of popularity thanks to affordable prices and up-to-date hardware. Samsung has managed to lower prices by selling these models online, reducing distribution costs. The sub-Rs. 15,000 Samsung Galaxy M30 set the pace, and a refreshed version, the Galaxy M30s, really helped the company strengthen its position in this segment. Samsung has now launched a successor to the Galaxy M30s, called the Galaxy M31. You now get a quad-camera setup, an upgrade from the triple camera setup on the M30s. However, the processor and the battery capacity remain unchanged. Will this be enough to keep the Galaxy M series competitive in the market? We review the Galaxy M31 to find out.\\n\\nAt first glance, it is hard to distinguish between the Samsung Galaxy M30s (Review) and the Galaxy M31 from the front. Both smartphones sport big 6.4-inch displays with waterdrop notches, which Samsung calls Infinity U displays, The bezels aren't thin, but are acceptable for the price. Just like with other M series smartphones, Samsung has used plastic in the construction of the Galaxy M31. The earpiece is sleek and sits right above the display in the frame of the smartphone.\\n\\nPick the Galaxy M31 up and it feels comfortable to hold in the hand. The sides are slightly curved which helps with grip. Samsung has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right of the device. The power button is easy to reach but the volume buttons could have been positioned better. On the left is the SIM tray which did not sit perfectly flush on our review unit. The Galaxy M31 has a 3.5mm headphone jack, primary microphone, USB Type-C port, and speaker at the bottom. The top only has the secondary microphone.\\n\\nWhen you look at the back of the Galaxy M31, you'll see some changes. The camera module is similar to that of the Galaxy M30s but it now packs a fourth camera. Next to this is the fingerprint scanner which was comfortable for us to reach while holding the smartphone.\\n\\nThe Galaxy M31 packs in a big 6,000mAh battery and weighs 191g makes the device feel a little heavy. Samsung has thankfully bundled a 15W charger in the box which should help keep charging times down. The company offers the Galaxy M31 in two colours, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We had the Space Black variant for review, and it picked up fingerprints and smudges very easily. There is no case in the box, so you may want to buy one.\",\n",

       " 'Mid-Range Beast\\nI had bought a Samsung M31 for me. I use it daily for a while and wanted to share my thoughts regarding the smartphone. The most appealing part of the phone is its massive 6000 mAh battery and its camera. Still, by having such a huge 6000mAh the weight balance is well maintained. Even if you do heavy gaming on this phone, the battery doesn‚Äôt drain out easily. The main highlight of this phone is not only its battery but also the 64mp camera. The camera provides many different modes like wide-angle mode, macro lens mode, etc which enhances the photographs. The 64mp camera inflates the quality of photographs to capture your unique moments. The rear-facing camera performed great. The front-facing 32mp camera is perfect to capture every detail of yourself. Both of the camera performance is good. The Beast M31 is powered by its own processor called Exynos 911 processor. I didn‚Äôt experience any lag or shutter while playing games or any application. The device has 6 GB RAM which enables multitasking more smoothly. The device has only a single speaker at the bottom but I think the speaker could be more slightly louder cause if we put our finger over it the sound mutes completely. Now talking about the design, I have a space black variant with the headphone jack, primary and secondary microphone and USB type C port, and fingerprint sensor on its back. The design is impressive and decent but I think that the built quality could be better as it has a polycarbonate back. The Display of 6.4-inch Infinity U display with Super AMOLED display protected with Gorilla Glass 3 which makes the phone smooth to use and protected with new display features. The Galaxy M31 is a good option if your looking for a phone under 20, 000 rs, and trust me that Galaxy M31 will not disappoint you. A great smartphone at a budget price.',\n",
       " 'nice phone. very user friendly. so heating problems, no hang issues.\\ni bought a 128GB RAM size and performance is pretty good so far. Battery back up is also fair. look and animations are excellent. overall a nice phone to have at this price range. another most important this to note is that the phone is manufactured in INDIA. YES!!! you heard it right -- \"INCREDIBLE INDIA\" jai hind!',\n",
       " \"OCEAN BLUE, 6+128\\n\\nThe product was delivered to me on 8th March 2020,so i am reviewing it after 3 months.\\n\\n1. Camera Quality\\n\\nThe quad camera is awesome, even some shots can be compared from cinematic shots you can zoom the pic upto extreme extend.\\nFront camera is 32MP and selfies are as good as the pics taken from rear camera Sometimes even better.\\nOverall camera is excellent .\\n\\n2. DISPLAY\\n\\nWith the phone equipped with superamoled along with infinity display you can watch some videos on YouTube even on 240p and it gives the feel of 360p quality.\\nNeedless to say about HD video their views are crystal clear.\\nAlthough the display is protected by Coring Gorilla 3 but i would suggest the buyers to apply screengaurd the quality of videos or the touchscreen functions would not be affected i can assure you for that.\\n\\n3. BATTERY LIFE\\n\\nThe most demanding feature in any cellphone.\\nFor normal usage like movies, calls, videos calls, music the battery would lasts upto almost 2days.\\nOn the otherhand if you are a heavy gamer like PUBG or CALL OF DUTY, then also you can play these games 8-10hours continuously.\\nI have played PUBG on M31 8 hours continuously with 15% battery remaining afterwards.\\n\\n4. GAMEPLAY\\n\\nPUBG never lags\\nWhenever i am playing with my squad they say the game is lagging as some squad or any enemy is approaching but i never ever experienced any type of lagging during gameplay except the network error problem or sometimes when internet is not working properly.\\nOtherwise, if you are a pro player of PUBG you can reach CONQUERER rank with this phone.\\n\\n5. RAM & ROM\\n\\nThe buyer will get almost 110gb of user space as their some pre-installed and system apps.\\nWith 6gb RAM you are all set for smooth and fast gameplay and multifunction.\\n\\n6. FINGERPRINT READER\\n\\nYou can add more than one fingerprint.\\nBeside that the sensor is at the back side so at times you can feel that the sensor should have been on screen otherwise the sensor responds quickly to the fingerprint.\\n\\nOverall it's best phone in the market below 20000.\\n\\nThe only missing quality was 8gb ram according to my opinion but on 29th May 2020 8gb RAM variant was also been launched.\\n\\nThe one and only drawback with this cellphone is its charging time as the battery capacity is 6000mAh but the charger is of 15W only so it takes 3hours to charge the battery 100%.\",\n",
       " '*Looks_Premium*\\nSamsung has gone with glasstic for the back of the phone ‚Äî plastic that looks and feels like glass ‚Äî which is smart, because it gives the phone a premium finish while keeping the weight low. And weight could have been a problem given that Samsung shoved a monster 6,000 mAh battery into this thing.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t let the \"glass\" in ‚Äúglasstic‚Äù fool you, it‚Äôs still plastic and still prone to scratches, and it‚Äôs glossy, making the phone slippery to hold, especially for someone as butterfingered as I am. On the bright side, the phone doesn‚Äôt look cheap, unlike its predecessor.\\n\\nBattery Life- An Absolute Beast\\n\\nPacking a whopping 6000mAh battery, the Galaxy M31 has managed to reach roughly the end of two days on a single charge, despite being connected to Wi-Fi for the majority of that time, with Bluetooth on and multiple wearables and a pair of wireless earbuds connected for good measure. That‚Äôs on top of the heavy use activities I mentioned previously. Simply put, you‚Äôd have to be a serious procrastinator to even think about draining the battery completely in a single day.\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy M31 ‚Äì 4\\nThe Galaxy M31 proves that having a multi-day battery life doesn‚Äôt cost the Earth, and if you were planning on using the M31 as your main media device of choice, this unbelievable battery life paired with the phone‚Äôs AMOLED screen makes for a match-made in heaven. You could binge content for hours on this thing.\\n\\nThe only letdown is the supposed inclusion of 15w fast charging, which I beg to differ. When hooked up to a power outlet, it took just over two hours to reach full charge from 8%. If charging your phone overnight is part of your routine then you‚Äôll never have an issue here, but needing a quick top up before you leave your home is just out of the question.\\n\\nCamera Quality- Good but not Best\\n\\nGood quad rear camera setup - 64MP main sensor + 8MP wide-angle lens + 5MP depth sensor\\nShots taken with the primary camera during daylight are quite satisfactory, images are detailed, especially the 64MP shots, and they showcase good dynamic range\\nThe ultra-wide sensor, like on any budget phone, is a good addition - it takes social media-worthy images in great lighting conditions (in low-light, the quality dips and pictures look grainy and noisy, wide-angle shots also have barrel distortion at the edges)\\nPhotos taken in low-light looks good - switching to Night mode helps reduce grain in the output and further improves image quality\\nLive Focus shots are quite impeccable and the camera app does give you the option to set the level of blur before taking a shot - edge detection is very good and the Galaxy M31 does a good job of separating the subject from the background\\nThe macro camera takes decent shots outdoors (though, the quality dips when indoors and the output is restricted to 5MP in resolution)\\nThe 32MP selfie camera is quite good and takes detailed selfies (though, in low light, the quality goes down a notch and results are grainy)\\nOverall, the cameras on the M31 are good for the price bracket, even though they are not the best (that title crowned to the POCO X2)\\n\\nOverall Verdict:\\nSamsung\\'s Galaxy M31 delivers the promise of long-lasting battery life and one of the best in its class in the market. In the camera department too has improved a lot over the predecessor.',\n",
       " 'Nice phone with almost all advanced features.\\nPros:-\\n1. Display is FHD and full marks to it.\\n2. Sound quality is ok.\\n3. Android 10 is handy.\\n4. Full marks ro 64MP quad camera.\\nCons:-\\n1. Battery is never felt like 6000mah. Rather it performs like 4500mah.\\n2.while receiving the call the panel sensitivity is poor.\\n\\nOverall value for money. Must buy.',\n",
       " \"On the day, the mobile was released I couldn't hold my excitement and ordered this Monster. Honestly, I wasn't expecting anything else from this except battery life. I needed a smartphone with bigger battery that lasts longer than usual so that I can do everything that I want to.\\n\\nTalking about the battery life, it works as promised. On Wifi, I used continuously on Day 1, and it took 21hrs to drain from 100% to 0%. And I tested on mobile data the next day, it took around 15hrs to drain completely. Im super impressed with the battery life that I will blindly get a smartphone from Samsung if it has a big battery.\\n\\nFingerprint reader and Face recognition are pretty fast. I was never expecting this speed at all. Camera quality is really good. I always had doubts in mind about cameras in Samsung, but this one cleared off everything. I feel proud to have this when I see the pictures on other handsets.\\n\\nMany people have misconceptions and complain about the processor in Samsung mobiles. Actually, it all depends on your usage. Processors in Samsung handsets aren't outdated, they deliver pretty good performance. I never had any such problem.\\n\\nThe mobile is not lightweight like other mobiles. But, a 6000mah smartphone of today will definitely have this much weight. I hope the design will change in future to have a lightweight smartphone with bigger battery.\\n\\nFinally, I want to conclude that if you want a phone that targets Productivity, M series is best. And M31 is the King of this segment.\",\n",

       " 'After a months use I will highly recommend this phone to all heavy users. The camera and battery are two of the best pros to buy this mega monster. Screen is awesome and clearly visible in bright sunlight. One very important benefit is that when you connect the phone to computer for taking photos or files from your phone, its very easy to find the files or photos from phone memory, whereas its a nightmare to find your data on most of the Chinese brands. Its the best option out there, so dont try any other Chinese phones but buy Samsung Galaxy M31.',\n",

       " ' Writing this review after using this phone approx 26 days..\\nSo there will be complete review about this..\\nWhy i brought this:-\\nBecause i want to switch more safer android smartphone, market of samsung is less than others cheap prices tag company phones but in Android nothing is more safer than samsung.. because there security patch is better in terms of all..\\nAlso i need better UI, i was earlier using MIUI, & want to use new Ui specially with flagships tag phones..\\nIn world people prefer Apple than samsung..\\nIn India we brought what we saw is cheaper or just processors.\\nWhat they \"‡§≠‡§æ‡§à ‡§á‡§∏‡§Æ‡•á snapdragon hai\" just snapdragon doesn\\'t makes ur phone good or best..\\nSamsung has world class infrastructure to provide the best thing to u not just anything without prior experience...\\nSo heres few things i like most..\\n1. Super Amoled Display: its having suoer amoled display which is way better than anyone in this budget.. as samsung super amoled consider as best due to high ppi.. which makes every dot if colors very good..\\nSuitable for netflix, prime, video watchers .\\n2. Battery: it has 6000 mah battery which is highest in this budget segment with 15W fast charging, took almost 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100%\\nBut belive me if its charge 100% use continuously till evening, and still u have 20-30% left..\\nPS: normal use, not games..\\n3. Quad camera: it has quad camera 64-8-5-5 which is also not available in this budget segment in any others..\\nSame configuration..\\nPlys sasmung has better image processing softwares and good sensors..\\nHence the camera quality is also good... I had attach pics too..\\n64 mp main camera, 8mp wide angle, 5 mp macro camera, 5mp depth camera.. 32 mp front camera..\\nWith 64MP Ultra-High Resolution ISOCELL also Bright GW1 image sensor\\n.\\nSlow mo with super slowmo which is way better, live focus, night mode is excellent... 4K recording from front as well as primary camera\\nAll these are good...\\n\\n4. Exyons 9611: it has Exyons 9611 which is better than many processor, it runs PUBG as well as many heavy games at HDR quality without any frame rate down, not even lags..\\nSo good one.. yes its not better than snapdragon but yes it works better till now i found nothing negative from processor..\\n\\n5. Audio: it has one good quality of speakers and very loud..\\nIt comes with Dolby atmos hence using external source of speakers from this phone is way better..\\n..\\nBest phone in under 20K segment, i brought this in 17K 6-128Gb configuration..\\nIf u want this for just only Gaming than dont prefer this, if u want daily use mobile with less gaming, and high usage of videos, social sites surfing etc than its best one..\\n.\\nWhat i was thinking to get more\\n1. Gorila glass 5 for screen instead of 3\\n2. Face lock little bit faster (although no use of face lock bcoz maximum prefer finger lock)\\n3. Liquid cooling technology if possible (bcoz if u play pubg for more than hours in full settings it will heat little bit but not as Xiomi phones did)\\n4. Want some more colors.. only royal blue & black with plastic body.. still it looks bettee\\nI m using black one..\\n5. Atleast add Case in mobile box, only charger provided...\\nI hope i added the valid points..\\n..\\nPS:- it is made in India, and has no links with China bcoz samsung has world largest factory in Noida where these phones were made, not assembled.. most of the parts were manufactured in India, only super amoled screen shipped from South Korea and few other parts from various countries..\\nAs all company\\'s did.. but has no link with china.. for more google it',\n",

Battery - Although the phone has a fast charging capability, my device takes roughly between 1.5 to 2.5 hours to completely charge, which is a bit disappointing, but the battery lasts easily for 24 hours so that's okay. Still disappointed about the slow charging bit.\\n\\n2. Camera - The primary camera performs best in an outdoor lighting condition with a fairly decent color reproduction. The EIS for 1080p videos is good. The front-faced camera captures good pictures and records video decently in indoor lighting conditions. Didn't get to check it in an outdoor condition.\\n\\n3. Other features - The build quality looks premium. The volume and the power buttons appears to be of good quality. The finger print sensor has a quick response time which is great. The touchscreen quality is indeed good. The OS operates well, I haven't noticed any lag so far. The dark mode is a welcome addition to this phone. Call quality is very good. The speakers are fairly loud given there's only 1 speaker grill at the bottom.\\n\\nOverall, in my opinion M31 is a value for money phone from Samsung.\",\n",

The smartphone features smooth edges and round corners, which makes it comfortable to hold the device. Apart from the large display, the front also houses a 32MP selfie camera. The right side houses the volume rockers and power button and the left is home to the SIM card tray and microSD card slot. The mono speaker, USB Type-C charging port and 3.5mm audio jack are located on the bottom of the device. The Samsung Galaxy M31 comes with a shiny rear panel which attracts a lot of fingerprints.

There are lot of features in this phone and i do like all of them. So the biggest problem i experienced is with the fingerprint scanner, the fingerprint scanner is not very responsive at all. I also have a galasxy M20 at home and in comparison the fingerprint scanner is a thousand times better in it. The fingerprint scanner in this device is slow and it sometimes doesn't even recognise my fingerprint. While unlocking it sometimes straightaway shows the message that please put the password we cant recognize the fingerprint. Registering a diffrent fingerprint didnt help at all and sometimes some apps stop working too for instance google chrome isnt working since the past week and i cant even delete and re install the app. Over all fingerprint scanner is the only big issue. I keep the fingerprint scanner clean and dry at all times even my finger.

I am a heavy user with about three hours talk time, another two hours using the phone as my tab, checking mails and working on other apps. Besides this I listen to music and an episode of a web series and checking faebook. All these put together, the battery lasted for more than one and half day. Moreover, even with a 6000 mAh battery, this phone looks surprisingly small and light.\\nNext comes the display which is Samsung's forte and it is stunning aa ever. The black is black and the colours are brilliant.\\nCamera is quite good. I recorded a dance performance of about 5 minutes which has come out very well with all details. However, low light performance is not the best. Overall, camera performance will get a very good from me.\\nNavigation is easy though I like stock android more.\\nHowever, this is not the fastest phone. Exinose 9611 is an old processor and even with 8GB ram ( I have two M 31) the speed of multitasking is moderate. But, that is sufficient for me since I am not a heavy gamer. And at this price range, I think it gives more than enough.\\n\\nHowever, one thing of this phone which is really annoying is the length of the charger chord. I have not come across such a short chord in any phone. It is barely 2 ft and you have to keep the phone very close to the charging point which at many times is not possible and hence becomes a real challenge\\n\\nOverall, I am very satisfied till now. My last phone was Nokia 7 plus and this NEW is definitely scores over that by a good length. In fact, this better than Redmi Note 9 which is driven by SD720.. A great value for money.\",\n",

The details, colour generation and the vibrancy of the colours are truely soothing to eyes. Apart from that it comes with Samsung EXYNOS octacore processor accompanied with a 6 GB DDR4 ram which does a decent job, for normal user it works absolutely fine and if you are into high end games then it might not be the best option. In addition , it has a moster battery capability with 6000mah battery it covers the entire day pretty smoothly eventhough it has been used quite rigorously, that inclues browsing internet heavily, watching 1080p videos on youtube, talking throuh video calls so on and so forth. It also supports dual 4g sim simultaneously that means you can use 2 4g sims with LTE option on at the sam time. Cameras are also does a decent job, which comes with 64 Mega Pixels primary camera along with 3 other cameras for depth and other functionality, its front camera is of 32 Mega Pixels which performs pretty nicely. There are few drawbacks in that phone and they are its back is made of plastic which could have been replaced by metallic materials and looks of the phone could have been beautified 10 times of it has been given. Another cons I would say its camera inspite of having 64 megapixels in low light its performance drops a little. That's is all about the phone .

Very impressive camera in this price range\\n2.battery life : I am in aww with the battery performance of this phone it can easily stand upto 1.5 days to 2 days...( I use phone 10_12 hours a day for surfing, music and movies .

Form factor and handling of phone is good, can be slippery if held without a back cover.\\n4. Camera clarity is good\\n5. The hardware specs is great considering the price point\\n\\nDislikes:\\n1. Feels marginally heavy when compared to rivals\\n2. Bloatwares installed and notification pop-ups is annoying\\n3. Pictures captured using Macro lens has noise and doesn't reflect the actual clarity.\\n4. Options to toggle from within the camera application to different modes needs time to get used to, feels hectic at the initial use.\\n5. Refresh rate and caching could have been better as the device slows down when several apps are all open.\\n\\nMy camera usage is low (<10 pics a week), have moderate number of applications and on screen usage (viewing) is about approximately 5 hours a day utmost (being practical), watching videos is pleasure on this device.\\n\\nIf buying a device is 1, practical understanding of hardware(specs) and usage of the device is also to be considered.\\n\\nIf you're someone who expects high-end features after paying for this device, Samsung alone might be able to help probably by the next decade based on competition and evolution of technology.\\n\\nUnsure if people are reasonable, Samsung is.\\n\\nVerdict: A great deal for the bucks spent.\\n\\n(This is in no way a paid promotion).\",\n",

Many said me that don't go for it if you want to play but it never lagged or heated up while playing high end games.Super smooth usage and interface.\\n\\n2. Camera is drop dead awesome. It literally justifies the 64 mp quad camera.\\n\\n3. I guess no one can give a negative comment on the sleek and classy look of the phone. It feels great to hold and 10 on 10 for looks.\\n\\n4. Screen resolution and quality is also super fine.\\n\\nCons-\\n1. The quick charge is almost equal to normal and there is nothing to get excited about.\\n\\n2. The battery is unable to justify 6000 mah as it claims. Other brands offering 4000mah lasts equal to this and after good all day usage u need to plug it again in the night. I expected that 6000mah will go 2 days easily but not in this case.\\n\\nConclusion- After such detailed analysis after 5 months, I can easily say that the pros can easily oustand the cons and this is one of the best budget phone Samsung has offered. And with such a reliable tag of Samsung, go for it without a second thought.\\n\\nYou will see that the other brands will offer somewhat same features in little less price but I would suggest you to go for this as this deserves the every extra penny spend, and ofcourse not a Chinese product.\",\n",

       " \"When I was looking to upgrade from my old phone I was essentially looking for something that went along the lines of long term usage, good battery life, big storage, a decent ram speed and most of all a decent camera quality; I was looking for all of that in a mid range phone, I am a loyal Samsung customer but in the last couple of years the product was a bit disappointing so I kept myself away from it as much as I could..\\n\\nBut when I read through the reviews and test videos for this phone I had no doubt about what my next purchase would be and I bought it after weeks and comparing and checking out other stuff and I am so happy that I decided on this to be my phone..\\nLet's start with the following.\\n\\nBattery : with 6000mh battery my days off worrying about low battery life is now all in the past, with minimal usage I easily get about 2 days of work done on my phone but if I am gaming then it's easily a day and a half to dot and that makes me a happy woman, the only thing that comes with a battery that big is it makes the phone a bit heavy but that's okay.\\n\\nCamera: the picture quality is quite good for a phone at this range and even with moderate lighting the phone does a wonderful job helping you with those aspects, since I do a lot of video calling with it helps good with those aspects.\\n\\nGraphics, storage and speed: it's fast, it's big with 128gb internal storage and 6gb ram space this phone gives me enough storage and functionality speed I need to do my day to day work on the phone without worrying about any lags on things, which for a mid range phone is very impressive.\\n\\nYes it has a headphone jack but the package doesn't come with a pair of ear phones that most previous phones came with but if you already have a existing ear phones that work then you don't need to worry.\\n\\nFast charge that charges you phone to full capacity within 2 and a half hours is lifesaver, I still don't know if wireless charging is a possibility but I am happy with what I have right now\\n\\nOver all, I am really happy with the product I've purchased\",\n",
       " \"What I didn't like is-\\nCons-\\n1) because of the big screen to body ratio, it is hard to hold the phone without activating any functions near the screen edges.\\nPros-\\n1) first time after old Nokia feature phone days I am charging the phone only twice a week.\\n2) Super AMOLED display is really crisp and efficient\\n3) smooth running, smooth charging\\n4) no heating up.\\n5) good camera features\",\n",
       " 'After almost a month of standard use. I must say I am happy with the battery life, it lasts almost two days. The touch is butter smooth. A good and bright display. The finger print is super fast. The camera quality could have been better, not happy with it. As I owned a Lumia 950 earlier, I still feel the display and camera of Lumia is better than this one.',\n",
       " 'Samsung has done a pretty good job in the mid range segment with it\\'s M series of smartphones.\\n\\nDisplay: Thanks to the S-OLED the display is crisp and clear with excellent viewing angles, better than any other non samsung phones in the mid range segment. Colour reproduction is excellent, but too sharp if set on vivid. You can set it to natural through display settings for more natural feel.\\nRating: 5 of 5.\\n\\nBattery: First ever phone containing a 6000 mah battery. Believe me it is a mammoth battery, It gives a day and half battery backup with medium use. Normal use can easily last for 2 days. Phone feels light knowing it has a mammoth battery. I have Asus Max pro M1 with 5000 mah battery feels heavy compared to Samsung M31.\\n\\nRating: 5 of 5\\n\\nPerformance: The Exynos 9611 does a pretty decent job in handling daily phone activities. It handles pubg well too. But mind it this is a midrange phone, considering this it\\'s awesome on gaming part too. For pubg, on high settings the device gets a bit hot but that\\'s normal since pubg uses a lots of hardware resources and some game lag here and there, but again it\\'s ok at this price point.\\n\\nRating: 5 of 5\\n\\nSound: Sound is a taken care of a mono speaker on the bottom right of the phone, Not loud but ok enough. The placement of speaker is odd for me though as my hand comes over the speaker while in landscape mode for watching videos or movies. Sound through headphones is nice (depends on your headphones too). I have a House of Marley Smile Jamaica earphones and the sound produced is crystal clear.\\n\\nSound: 4 of 5\\n\\nCamera: My god the rear cameras are excellent in good lights. You can zoom the picture taken to the point it can\\'t be zoomed further and you will find no or negligible noise in the pictures. Front selfie camera does a decent job too. Can be better in low light as the pictures taken are noisy and grainy. This will be eliminated in further OTA updates (Hope so). Videos are excellent too. The camera app includes all features for tiktokers too.\\n\\nRating: 4 of 5.\\n\\nCall Quality: The most important factor of a phone which is rarely reviewed, only one word \"Excellent\". No unusual sounds while on call through the earpiece, even when on loudspeaker you can hear the other person very well even if you have some disturbances around. Mic does an excellent job as well the person on other can hear you clearly.\\n\\nRating: 5 of 5\\n\\nStorage: It depends on the variant you choose. I bought one with 6gb ram and 128 gb internal storage. Massive storage at this price. 6 gigs of RAM ( DDR4) helps you seamlessly multitask without any lags or reloads.\\n\\nRating: 5/5\\n\\nConclusion: A must buy mid range device that has all the features a smartphone user wants. Truly an all rounder device.',\n",

       " ' Received my phone on 5th March 2020. Same day delivery provided by Amazon. I am using this phone for the last 3 months. I selected this phone for the battery backup 6000mAh and internal memory 128GB. I am happy as the phone performs well in these requirements. Please note that the network signal is not good at my office location and naturally phone would get discharge very fast. After full charge at 08:00 AM my phone battery capacity is showing at 47% at 11:00 PM at night. 64 mega pixel quad Camera at rear side. Picture quality is good. We can adjust the brightness while taking photos. Wide lens option for group photos is quite useful. Slow motion and super slow motion options are available. Fingerprint sensor is fast. On the box \"made in India\" label is printed and I feel proud. Arogyasetu app is running with bluetooth on 24X7. Ear phones are not part of package. Overall I am happy with my purchase.',\n",

I am not a gamer and hence cannot say anything about it. Camera all modes advertised are available and working well. It is a great value for money for its features and specifications.

When we use this smartphone it really feels like we have a device with all the features that we get on a Laptop/Desktop. The camera quality is also best as every snapped photo has pinpoint details. The slow motion feature is the one that I liked the most and we can even edit the recorded videos on this device itself. The last but not the least is its sound quality of speaker and headphones mode is really remarkable plus outstanding.

I got one and half days battery back up which is good. Overall photo quality is very good. I have switched all my apps and datas from my old phone to my new samsung M31 by using Samsung Switch app which works nicely. The phone is having dedicated sim and memmory card slots. The fast charging works smoothly. No heating issue for normal use. Sound quality is also decent. Even though it is made of plastic it looks very good in appearance.\\nSome of the demerits are it is not having nofication light however the way in which the AMOLED display the notification is superior to having notification light.

Pictures quality is much better than Chinese phones even didn't expected this type of camera quality from Samsung's.\\n\\n4) never heating since bought.\\n5) face lock and figure sensor is working fast.\\n\\nSo this phone has many good reasons to buy, there is nothing to dislike.\",\n",
       " \"Wow! Finally a budget phone in the mid range packed with features that you generally expect in the realmes or redmis. After using it for good 10 days here's my review:\\nBATTERY LIFE- The battery on this one is the star. This 6000mAh powerhouse does deliver. Even after 3 hrs of video calling, power consumption is just 20%. Intense gaming, use of camera, e mails,online video playback and lots more, it can handle anything you throw at it. Charging is slow but you have to consider that 6000mAh battery would take some time to charge up. You charge it once and wouldn't need to do it again for the entire day.\\n2. DISPLAY: In this area also the AMOLED display will win you over, with the drop notch design is very pleasing to the eyes, colour and contrast are also great.\\n3. CAMERA: The pictures are amazing in bright light, the wide angle lens also works fine, however macro or low light pictures may not be up to the mark. 64 MP sensor is not default and have to be changed in the camera settings. But the picture do have great depth, colour, contrast and resolution. The 64 mp camera performs better than other mobile phones in terms of clarity and true colour.\\nOS: Android 10 with Samsung skins.\\nOverall: great product worth purchasing.\",\n",

Front camera is also good, clear.\\n5. Screen flash is enough to give you decent quality pic at zero light.Frankly speaking I did a lot of experiments in a dark room.\\n6. It never heat up when charging. One or 02 days it heated up when I was charging at middle of the day and outside temperature was 42¬∞c. Otherwise in the morning time it charge quick and fast.\\n7. My friends told me dont buy samsung as samsung phone hang a lot. I have use 2 samsung phone earlier, so I know they are right but still I bought this phone for camera as 64mp samsung camera, so I ignore that. After using a month I gave my phone and said use as much as application, if it will hang I will give this phone free. They use 15 applications at a time and playing pubg in this phone. They did not found any lags even.\\n8. The ram availability is less 3.4 to 3.6 while not using. While using still you will have 1.4 gb available after using 12 applications were opened.\\n9. Fingerprint reader work fast , accurate better than my last phone J7 max.\\n10. Look wise it gives the feeling of Samsung S20 phone, lite weight . Better than any phone.\\nDear all, go blind for this , you will not regret 1% even.',\n",

Fingerprint sensor is very responsive and even unlocking of phone with front camera works fine. Some gesture controls (screen shot and single hand use) could be improved. Works fine with Airtel and considerably good WiFi calling function. Let's see how long it lasts with my rough usage.\",\n",

You have the choice if you want to take pictures in 64 MP or not. As 64MP takes a lot of size.\\nThe quality of the pictures are perfect too.\\n\\nAs I said I don't play games, so I would not be able to comment on that.

About the safety features, fingerprint sensor and face unlock is there to open this truck with a decent performance, rear camera with 64mp is great(macro wide etcüëå)and also the front camera 32mp give clear pictures and videos.Coming to engine side it works in any terrain without any delay and moreover no heating issues from engine side. Another top feature is the fuel capacity(6000mah battery) that it give a huge backup for long running. Overall it is the mega monster truck that going to defeat all other trucks in the market.',\n",
       " 'The reason I went for the M31 was because most reviews I adjudged it as \"bang for the buck\", and because Samsung is a trusted brand. I was familiar with the M series as my mother owns an M30s and after a week of using this phone, I am glad I made the decision to buy it.\\n\\nFirstly, the most amazing thing about the M31 is the battery life. The battery comfortably lasts for more than 30 hours with moderately heavy use. The 15W charger keeps charging times fairly low. The M31 comes with Android 10 pre-loaded and the dark mode is something I really love! The performance is smooth, the UI is neat and clean, and the display looks crisp with good vibrancy. I really like the camera\\'s performance in daylight and the quality of the images is quite sharp. However, I felt that low light photos are quite decent and could be better. The phone feels slightly heavier than the M30s because of the bigger battery but the difference is not very noticeable. I bought the Space Black version and while it looks classy, it does pick up fingerprints easily. I would recommend getting a case for that reason, even though the phone is quite comfortable to grip. Ergonomically, the buttons are well-placed and the fingerprint sensor works really well. I feel that on the whole, the phone is perfect for anyone looking for a durable device that can cover all the bases within the 15-20K range!\\n\\nPROS\\n- Battery Life\\n- Daylight Camera\\n- Display\\n- Android 10 UI\\n\\nCONS\\n- Night Shots\\n- Spammy notifications (can be easily disabled)',\n",

The same Exynos 9611 chipset from it's predecessor M30s is a decent processor and it handles the day to day tasks pretty well but the mobile feels under-powered for some reason.

On the design front, M31 looks like an identical twin of M30s except for the camera module which houses 4 lenses.\\n\\nThe quad cam is good for daylight shooting. In the night, it does feel that Samsung could've done better. But again, considering the price range and other features packed in the phone, its forgivable, I would say. The charging is quite slow because of the 6000 mah battery.\\n\\nThis is my third day with the phone and wrt to the first impression, I can say that this phone is a winner. If your are planning to buy one, I would recommend you to buy the 128 GB version. Hardly 1000 bucks more than the 64 GB version.

Lastly, the most commendable camera setup of 64MP+8MP with an Ultra wide lens and 32MP front facing camera is the highlight of the handset.

Front camera - Again great, clicks amazing pictures, live focus works in almost every condition where there is decent lighting.\\n‚óè Battery life is better than any phone at this price point.\\n‚óè Finger print reader is really fast, even works with slightly wet fingers.\\n‚óè processor (soc) - Exynos 9611 is very good CPU for daily usage, but if you are buying this for gaming then please refrain from buying this phone, not that good gaming performance compared to other phones at this price point.\\n‚óè 6 GB RAM is more than enough for any work you do in this phone... app reset in backgrounds in very rare because of huge RAM size...\\n‚óè AND MAIN FOCUS - THE AMOLED DISPLAY - the display is simply gorgeous... pixel density is great, watching HD or 4K movies is very pleasing in this display...\\nI would rate 4.8/5 stars, I would recommend this phone to everyone who isn't a 'Hardcore Gamer'.... This phone just satisfy all my needs...\",\n",
       " 'I bought this phone because of the brand name \"samsung\". The first touch phone which I was used is Samsung(sliding type with touch). When I saw the add of this m31 I fixed this in mind.\\nThis phone is one of the most fantastic phone which I have ever seen. There is no words to say about The Batery life. It is Amazing. I can watch continuously 6 movies from 100%. Still the charge is 50% only . Even in my nonstop use I am getting 2.5 days battery life.\\nCamera quality is also an amazing thing. Video quality is like a Digital camera video. Photos are getting more and more clear during zooming. Camera clarity is supeeeeerrr..\\nFingerprint reader is excellent . It is too fast in unlocking using finger.\\nRam is also fabulous. No hang or delay. Sound quality is also super.\\nFrom my point of view I have no negatives to say. This is an excellent phone . A huge facility in an affordable budget. I suggested this phone to 2 of my friends and the purchased too... so dear friends pls choose this phone, u will not get this much features in any other phone. Others may have more features but they have no battery life and maximum 6 hrs back up. They have no brand value also. A small battery with more load can\\'t use for more time. But our samsung is king. Pls try once u loved it u will not change ur mind.\\nStill I am fall in love with samsung. Especially the battery life... thank you samsung team for giving this gift to us. ........',\n",

       " 'The Samsung Galaxy has released a literal Monster in the form of their model M31, absolutely at the top of the game in terms of Battery Life, Performance, Display, and of course, the Photography.\\nThe Quad camera is unparalleled and with offers like the 8Mp Ultra Wide angle that is more than useful to capture stunning shots in life, and the 5MP macro and depth feature to provide for realistic high quality pictures, it is definitely one of the best in the business.\\nThe Dual Octa Core processor with a memory expandable upto 512GB and the 6000mAh battery with fast C-type charging provides excellent tools and time to students, business persons, and all fields alike.\\nLastly, the Screen Resolutions, RAM Performance and excellent Security provide for an absolute whopping Monster just like namesake and as verified by many agencies, it can be said with absolutely no doubt that this model is more than a Megastar in the budget category.',\n",
       " \"Best all-rounder Mobile with in the price range. Used for 10days. So far no issues found. Amazing display quality than expected. Monster Battery is good losting about 1.5 day. Camera quality is good not the best. Only major drawback is it is taking more time to charge almost 2.5hours to 3 hours. Company claimed quick charge actually it's not quick. Instead of 2A if they provide 4A charger it will be good. Anyway good product and great value for money.\",\n",
       " 'Great phone in this price segment.\\nI feel fingerprint reader is a it slow if compared to A series phone, but still way better than the other brands. 6000mah battery phone is definitely a monster. Camera quality is really great but there is definitely some room for improvement.\\nA good 15000inr smartphone which is capable of playing games like ping, COD etc.\\nOverall experience is great, recommending this phone.',\n",
       " 'Although the phone has 6000 mAh battery. It is only slightly better than other 5000 mAh phones as the equinox processor in M31 sucks. It is almost 2 generations behind the latest snapdragon processor. As equinox is also owned by samsung, it is a scam to promote their products. This is the major setback of the phone. Rest everything is fine as expected from a typical samsung phone. I gave 5 stars so that this would come in the top of review section.',\n",
       " \"Pros-\\n1.) Awesome battery life; I charged alternative days\\n2.) Processor is good, gaming handles well, runs through everyday tasks\\n3.) Charging is pretty fast (thanks to the 15 W charger) takes around 1.5 hours to completely charge from 15%\\n4.) Camera quality is great, stable mode is the best I had great videos with it.\\n5.) Loudspeaker is actually very loud, much louder than other counterparts in the same range.\\n6.) And how to forget about the display, which is just awesome; AMOLED panel with great colours and very high brightness.\\nCons-\\n1.) Fingerprint scanner could have been faster, though it does the job well.\\n2.) Camera is locked; can't install Gcam mod without root.\\nRest I feel the phone is pretty good, can't go wrong with this one, a great choice in this price range\\nAnd obviously samsung offers great service, so that's a bonus.\\nAll in all, I'm happy with the purchase.\",\n",
       " 'This was definetely a great upgrade from Samsung for me as I have been a customer since last 5 years.\\nHighlights for me\\n1.Macro camera-It capture pictures with every minute details.\\n2.64 MP camera-This is something next level as images were size more than 8 mb according to lighting conditions which is equivalent to dslr sizes and detailng is also crystal clear here.\\nMoreover the Monster Battery that stands out over all of these 6000mah,once full charge in the morning can easily run for 2 days.\\nLoved it.',\n",
       " \"Samsung has done a decent job on M31. It doesn't contain any bloatware nor any over utilization of the apps.\\nIts smart feature on zipping the apps, moving apps to SD cards is the feature that makes this mobile stand out.\\nThe Camera has an intelligent processor along with the aperture quality. Low-light testing is still not done.\\nsAMOLED does its job as promoted by Samsung. Cell is little heavy due to it 6000 mAH battery but you can used to it over a period of time. Overall the product is worth the investment.\",\n",
       " \"The phone is best for both the students and the commoners. As I am a student, this phone is apt for everything. The biggest selling point of this phone is that it has got a 6000 mAh battery capacity which could go for at least 2 days with all the full usage of the phone. So people always search for pros and cons of a particular device. This thing has also got some of them.\\n\\nPros:\\n1. The massive battery capacity 6000 mAh is enough to attend all your live classes, do all your assignments and even some good gaming.\\n2. The screen size is very good. Not too big neither too small. It's in between. So the phone is very handy and useful.\\n3. The 64 MP camera is I think the best camera in the world. Compiling it with macro and ultarwide this phone is a camera beast in itself and can take some awesome night shoots as well as potraits.\\n4. Both the fingerprint sensor and face id is fast enough. Unlocks the phone in no time and locks the phone as the screen goes off.\\n5. This thing can do some pretty performance in gaming. Its not a gaming phone but can handle it like a pro.\\n6. This phone has also got Dolby Atmos which can work only through Bluetooth devices but when paired up it produces a good music quality.\\n\\nCons:\\n1. This thing has a plastic back which invites a lot of fingerprints, grudges and scratches on the back of the phone.\\n2. Does not provide a case in the box. You have to purchase it seperately.\\n3. To charge a 6000 mAh battery the box provides only a 15w of charger which takes like 3 full hours to charge this thing up.\\n4. It does not have samsung pay nor it has bixby. So that makes the phone not to be used in payments.\\n5. Does not come with an earphone in the box. Though it has a 3.5mm headphone jack but still you have to purchase it seperately.\\n\\nBut I think this phone is preety darn good. It can handle anything from classes to gaming to assignments to voice calls. Even it's speaker is good even if you are not using Bluetooth headsets.\",\n",

       " \"Really good product.. been using for a couple of week right now.\\nLet's look at this in a good fashioned Pros/Cons manner shall we?..\\n\\nPros :\\n1. Super Amoled Screen : The super Amoled screen is a blessing in disguise and its one of those things that you don't know you needed until you get it.. after using this phone or any samsung phone with sAmoled screen you would be really disappointed with any other phone you get purely because of the screen quality.. I've watched and rewatched many movies in my phone as the quality is literally mesmerizing which just couldn't be achieved by my laptop screen.\\n2. Camera : Goes without saying that the camera is really good. By default it does not use 64mp camera as pictures taken in 64mp have really large sizes but you can change the camera quality to 64mp from within the camera app.. the photo quality is similar to the category of iPhones/Pixels as in the camera is more lifelike and 'real' rather than the oppo/vivo immensely beautified camera.. super slow motion, super stable mode, 4k video capture are really good functionalities if you're into that sort of thing.\\n3. Performance : 6gb ram is really good and the samsung processor with android 10 os properly optimizes the phone to perform various operations simultaneously without overheating problem.\\n4. Gaming : I consider myself as a casual gamer and have faced no lag in any game that I've played even in really high graphics settings(in games like PUBG, Call of Duty, Asphalt 9, Sky, etc)\\n5. Fast Charging : the 15W fast charging adapter charges the phone very quickly so you don't have to wait and stare at the wall while waiting for your phone to charge for too long.\\n6. Design : I've got the space black model and saying that the overall design combining the screen, edges, back design, camera placement, etc is stunningly gorgeous would be an understatement.\\n7. Made in India and Not a Chinese Company : Samsung is a south Korean company with its biggest headquarters in Noida.\\nMany more pros but This review is getting kinda lengthy...so now Cons\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Battery: Not really a major con as the battery is actually really good and lasts for a long time but still it doesn't quite feels like the 6000mAh battery advertised.\\n2. Apps Hide: you can hide the apps from the menu but you can't truly hide an app as it can be searched from the search bar (maybe there is a different option to hide but so far I couldn't find one like the other Samsung mobiles)\\n3. 14-15 volume level gap : the audio volume gap from level 14 to level 15(max) is kinda high and sometimes it's tough to find a sweet spot.\\nThese are the only cons that I've come across till now.\\n\\nFinal Review : I would definitely suggest everyone to get this phone just for the sAmoled screen only. All the pros definitely outweigh the cons and for this budget this phone is a definite must buy.. I've used other phones in this price range too like the pocoX2 etc and trust me this phone is far better than anyother phone in this price range..\\nIf you are looking to buy a phone in this price range or even in a little higher price range you should get this phone as it won't disappoint.\",\n",
       " 'Pros:\\n\\nFingerprint reader: Less than a second response time is Amazing.\\n\\nCamera Quality : This phone got the best Quad core camera üì∏ in this range. The micro feature is the best that I liked one.\\n\\nBattery Life: This phone üì± has the monster battery actually. Single recharge of battery gives you the one and half day of normal usgae.\\n\\nWhy to buy? : The only budget branded phone you can trust. I have used almost every other phone but this one fits best in my range.',\n",
       " 'Though I am very skeptical about smartphones still I liked this Galaxy M31device very much. Here is my brief review about cam, battery, processor, ram and storage.\\n\\n#Camera quality is great (the best in this price range) in daylight. Low light capturing is also good, but not very good. You may find little noise while taking photos in low light (specially indoors). I expected a bit better. Full hd video recording feature with both the rear and selfie camera is a great added feature. Specially new youtube vloggers. 64mp main, wide angle, macro overall a well crafted cam setup. Depth sensor is also good with new options. But while taking protrait mode (live focus mode in this case) finishing of the blurry edges could have been better.\\n\\n#Battery is damn good and it does what it says (in the ads). If you are not a heavy user u can easliy survive one day and a half (even 2days, depends upon your usage) without charging.. if you play games like pubg, free fire frequently you will get a whole day with single charge for sure. And no heating issues at all.\\n\\n#Proccessor is wellcrafted for multitasking and with the support of 6gb #RAM it is great. Your regular work, social media, internet surfing, live streaming, movie watching, music and gaming will go very soomthly without any lag. But if you play high end graphic games or games like pubg with full graphics, after an hour or so you will see drop in the frame rates. Otherwise overall experience is good.\\n#Massive #storage of 128gb is definitely a feature liked by all no doubt. And you can easily upgrade it to more by simply adding a sd card in the dedicated sd card slot.\\nAs per my view, go for Samsung Galaxy M31..you wont regret it. üòä',\n",
       " 'When Samsung launched the Galaxy M30s last year, we were shocked to see how competitively the company had managed to price the phone. The M30s instantly made the Galaxy A50 feel too costly, and rightly so: Except for the in-display fingerprint sensor and better looking design, the Galaxy A50 was pretty much the same phone as the M30s, only with a considerably smaller battery.\\n\\nSamsung could simply have let the 6,000 mAh battery on the M30s be the highlight, but it didn‚Äôt. The Galaxy M30s had the new Exynos 9611 processor under the hood, a 48MP triple camera setup at the back, and a beautiful 6.4-inch Super AMOLED panel up front. In fact, Samsung told us at the Galaxy M31 launch that the camera, battery life, and display are the most important factors for young people nowadays, and those are the parameters it focused on when designing the Galaxy M31.\\n\\nHowever, since the battery life and display quality on the M30s were pretty top notch for the asking price, Samsung has focused on the camera experience with the Galaxy M31. There‚Äôs a 64MP camera at the back along with a macro camera, in addition to an ultra-wide camera and a depth sensor, while the front-facing camera has been upgraded to a 32MP sensor. Does the M31 have what it takes to be the amazing value proposition that the Galaxy M30s was last year? Let‚Äôs find out!\\n\\nGalaxy M31 design and display\\n\\nThe Galaxy M31 has a polycarbonate body that‚Äôs pretty much the same as the Galaxy M30s. Since there‚Äôs a 6,000 mAh battery inside, the M31 is heavy, but not so heavy that it would turn you off. However, the phone doesn‚Äôt feel very premium to hold, and that might not be to everyone‚Äôs liking despite the rather affordable price tag. The design is quite utilitarian, in short, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preferences.\\n\\nAt the back, the quad camera setup is housed inside a rectangular window in the upper left corner, with the words ‚Äô64 megapixels‚Äô mentioned next to the LED flash. It may come off as cheap to some, but in my opinion the font used for the text makes it look quite stylish. There‚Äôs also a capacitive fingerprint sensor next to the cameras, which I still think is the best solution for fingerprint recognition on phones.\\n\\nThe 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy M31 is excellent for this segment of the smartphone market. It has wide viewing angles, vivid colors, deep blacks, and pretty good brightness levels that only fall short in the harshest of sunlight. However, since this is the same panel as the one on the Galaxy M30s, the bezels are rather big for a 2020 smartphone. The bottom bezel in particular is an eyesore, though I guess we can‚Äôt complain considering the M31‚Äôs price tag.\\n\\nThe Galaxy M31 has a headphone jack, for those wondering. But you will have to buy your own headphones, as there are no earphones in the box. There‚Äôs no case, either: All you get is a USB-C cable and a 15W Samsung fast charger, which was also the case (no pun intended) with the Galaxy M30s. You will need a case, though, if you want to keep the phone in a pristine condition, as the back panel picks up scratches very easily.\\n\\nGalaxy M31 camera\\n\\nThe M31 is Samsung‚Äôs cheapest phone to feature a 64-megapixel rear camera, and using pixel binning, it takes 16-megapixel photos in auto mode. And daytime performance is pretty good. There‚Äôs plenty of detail in the photos and good dynamic range. The same goes for video recording. The M31 is also the cheapest Samsung phone to sport 4K video recording (at 30 fps), and apart from a lack of stabilization, videos captured in daylight look pretty good.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs the nighttime performance where the M31 drops the ball. First off, the phone simply has too much shake even when you hold it in two hands, and with a single hand, well, good luck getting a perfectly clear picture. If you do manage it, you get sufficient detail and little noise when there‚Äôs good artificial lighting around. In the dark, things aren‚Äôt so rosy. Samsung is marketing the M31 as having an amazing camera Night mode, but that Night mode isn‚Äôt exactly that great.\\n\\nFirst off, the Night mode photos are cropped considerably so you see a lot less in the frame compared to standard photos. Secondly, Night mode photos have a watercolor painting effect and often have their detail smudged when it should be the other way around. Finally, some scenes don‚Äôt show noticeable difference when captured in Night mode. Night mode is great for brightening up a scene when it‚Äôs too dark, but otherwise, it doesn‚Äôt really work as well as Samsung would make you think.\\n\\nHere are a couple of photos captured both in auto mode and in Night mode:\\n\\nThe ultra-wide camera on the M31 is an 8-megapixel sensor like the M30s‚Äô ultra-wide camera. It‚Äôs useful to capture a wider scene, but don‚Äôt expect to see any fine detail when you zoom in, especially at night. As for the 5MP macro camera, it‚Äôs great if you love taking close-up shots, though it‚Äôs often difficult to understand exactly when the object is in focus, resulting in a few out-of-focus shots.\\n\\nHere are a few samples from the rear cameras, including ultra-wide and macro shots.\\n\\nFor selfies, the Galaxy M31 has a 32MP camera and manages to take pleasing pictures outdoors. By default, you get 8MP photos, but you can switch to 32MP mode if you like to see more details in your selfies. At night, detail is lost whether it‚Äôs an 8MP photo or a 32MP photo, and you can also expect some camera shake if you don‚Äôt hold the phone steady using all the willpower you can muster.\\n\\nIn case you‚Äôre wondering, you can capture 4K videos with the front camera as well. Other camera features include Live Focus mode for bokeh shots with the front and rear cameras, which works pretty well most of the time (see some samples below). You can also capture Super Slow-mo and standard slow motion videos and create AR Emojis. Standard modes like Hyperlapse and Panorama are present as well.\\n\\nGalaxy M31 performance\\n\\nThe Galaxy M31 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M30s, Galaxy A50s, and Galaxy A51. It‚Äôs the processor choice for Samsung‚Äôs budget and lower mid-range phones, and all I can say is that it gets the job done in day-to-day use. The M31 runs smoothly as long as you don‚Äôt try to switch apps and browse through the user interface too quickly. Apps mostly launch quickly, and since there‚Äôs 6GB of RAM on both the 64GB and 128GB storage variants, multitasking isn‚Äôt usually an issue.\\n\\nGaming performance is pretty good in titles like Call of Duty and PUBG, at least at the default graphics settings. The phone can stutter here and there when you initially load a game and start playing, but those stutters don‚Äôt show up after the first minute or two. It also didn‚Äôt have issues running well at the ultra frame rate setting in PUBG, and games like Asphalt 9 and Modern Combat 5 also run fine. This is something I also noticed on the Galaxy A50 and M30s ‚Äì the Exynos 9610/9611 isn‚Äôt great for the general user interface, but its Mali-G72 MP3 GPU handles popular gaming titles very well.\\n\\nGalaxy M31 software\\n\\nLike every other Galaxy phone Samsung has launched in 2020, the Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 with One UI 2.0 out of the box. Well, it runs One UI Core 2.0, which is a stripped down version of One UI 2.0 that Samsung also brought to the Galaxy M20 and Galaxy M30 with the Android 10 update. You don‚Äôt get features like the built-in screen recorder or even something as basic as Secure Folder. Samsung Pay and Samsung Pay Mini aren‚Äôt supported, either. Bixby is completely missing as well, except for Bixby Vision in the camera app.\\n\\nAnd when I pressed Samsung about why the M series runs One UI Core even though devices like the M30s and M31 have the same processor as the Galaxy A51, which do get standard One UI 2.0 (though not with all features), I was told the company designs each phone according to the target market. But that doesn‚Äôt explain why stuff like Samsung Pay Mini and Secure Folder aren‚Äôt part of the package, and I can only assume Samsung wants to keep some features exclusive to costlier phones.\\n\\nSince the Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 out of the box, it will receive an update to Android 11 and Android 12 at some point. Android 11 might arrive quickly ‚Äì the Galaxy M20 and M30 received the Android 10 update before the Galaxy Note 10 did, after all. Security updates are likely to come once every three months for the first two years, and whenever necessary from the third year onward.\\n\\nGalaxy M31 battery life\\n\\nWith a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, it‚Äôs no wonder the Galaxy M31 can last a really long time on a single charge. I always got a full day of battery life with heavy usage, and with light to not-too-heavy use, you won‚Äôt have to charge it until late evening the next day, at least if you stick to mostly Wi-Fi. Switching to LTE brings down battery life, naturally, but you can still get a full day out of it with fairly heavy use.\\n\\nThe M31 supports 15W fast charging. With such a big battery, faster charging speeds don‚Äôt matter that much, and given the price point Samsung is targeting with the M series, we probably won‚Äôt see the fast charging specification change any time soon. Still, it would be nice to have, as a full charge from 0 takes around two hours and a half. An hour of charging takes the charge to around 30 percent, though that 30 percent does last a considerable while.\\n\\nGalaxy M31 audio and call quality\\n\\nThe M31 has a single bottom-firing loudspeaker that gets the job done if you‚Äôre in a small room but is too quiet to hear even at full volume otherwise. It‚Äôs the same story with every budget Galaxy phone, and the M31 doesn‚Äôt do anything to change that. Like the M30s‚Äô speaker, the M31‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt distort at the highest volume, though, which is a plus. It could just do with a bit more depth in the low frequencies (bass).\\n\\nFor wired audio, you will need to opt for a third-party product as no earphones are bundled with the phone. When used with earphones from other budget/mid-range Galaxy smartphones, the M31 produces sound that is very heavy on the high frequencies (treble) but lacks punch in the lower frequencies. As for call quality, I noticed no issues with either of the two SIMs I was using, except for the fact that both the earpiece and the loudspeaker are on the quieter side and make it hard to hear what the person on the other end is saying.\\n\\nGalaxy M31 verdict\\n\\nThe Galaxy M31 is more or less a Galaxy M30s with a macro camera, a higher-resolution main camera, more RAM on the base variant, and newer software out of the box. And the Galaxy M30s‚Äô base variant, priced at Rs 12,999, is the better pick if you‚Äôre on an extremely tight budget. If you have Rs 14,999 lying around, then the Galaxy M31 offers excellent value for money. It would have been nice to see more feature-packed software, better quality from the 64MP rear camera in low light, and perhaps an Infinity-O display with smaller bezels, but for the asking price, these are all nitpicks that shouldn‚Äôt affect your decision to get the phone.',\n",
       " 'Personally as a user i am using this phone for past few weeks as surprisingly this phone is best value for money.\\n.\\n.\\nFirst of all the Display is best highlight of this phone obviously Samsung AMOLED are best in the market and this phone have that display,so no complaint for the display. It measures 159.2 mm x 75.1 mm x 8.9 mm and weighs 191 grams. The screen has a resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels and 403 ppi pixel density. It has an aspect ratio of 19.5:9 and screen-to-body ratio of 83.92 %.\\n.\\n.\\nSecond\\ncamera-the main sensor is 64mp Samsung ISOCELL Bright GW1 sensor along with an f/1.8 lens. The camera setup has also an 8-megapixel secondary sensor with an f/2.2 ultra-wide-angle lens that comes with a field of view (FoV) of 123 degrees -- alongside a 5-megapixel macro shooter that has an f/2.4 aperture and a 5-megapixel depth camera with an f/2.2 aperture. There is support for Live Focus for an enhanced bokeh effect. Samsung has also provided dedicated night mode, super steady mode, and super slo-mo (using interpolation).\\nYou can record 4k at 30 fps. It has super steady mode for video recording which stabilize the video quite nicely.\\nIt has a dedicated Night mode for the night shot too.\\nIt Has 32mp selfie camera with AR doodle capabilities and also you can record slow motion video from the front camera.\\nOverall good Camera performance in this price range.\\n\\nThird\\nPerformance-Samsung has retained the Exynos 9611 SoC from the Galaxy M30s. This is an octa-core processor with four performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.3GHz and four efficiency Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. For graphics, it has the Mali-G72 GPU. You get 6GB of RAM and a choice between between a 64GB storage variant and a 128GB storage variant .\\nDirectly if we talk about PUBG it can Handle HDR with Ultra FPS.\\nBut prefer to play on HD at ULTRA FPS.\\n\\nOverall this phone is truly made for Indians and the best point is that this phone is manufactured in india.\\n\\nThe Galaxy M31 has two Nano-SIM slots and has support for 4G as well as VoLTE. It also supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS. Storage is expandable by up to 512GB.\\n\\nOn the software front, Samsung ships the new Galaxy M31 with OneUI 2.0 on top of Android 10. The software is similar to what we have seen on the recently launched Galaxy S10 Lite and Galaxy Note 10 Lite. We did find a fair amount of bloatware on Galaxy M31. Apart from the Google apps, Netflix, Facebook, Candy Crush Saga, and Samsung Max were preloaded on the smartphone. Samsung also has its own apps such as My Galaxy and Samsung Shop.',\n",
       " \"Using this phone for a year now. Never faced any problem.\\n\\nBattery\\nThe battery is super good and is the primary reason for buying this phone. It easily lasts 64 hours combined usage(18hrs screen on) for me from 100 to 0. My daily usage is mostly reddit and whatsapp so it will be less for heavy use. It is so easy for me to keep the phien between 30 to 70 pc extending its life further. Over last year of usage my batter y has only degraded from 5830 mah to 5050 mah.\\n\\nPerformance\\nPerformance is quite good. Never saw it lagging in any day to day task. I don't game much on my phone but played a little of Genshin Impact before switching to PC and it worked only okay. I was getting around 25 fps in open world and 15 fps in combat with multiple enemies so make of it what you want. However to be fair, Genshin is the most demanding game in mobile and it will behave similarly for other phoen in this price(Don't quote me on that though).\\n\\nCamera\\nI don't click photos so can't judge on that. Sorry.\\n\\nStrength and durability\\nThe backside gets dirty very easily. I have dropped the phone quite a many times(read twice a month) from my bed but no major scratch. I use a cheap 150rs screen protector and back cover for this so probably that saved it from the drop.\\n\\nMiscellaneous\\nFingerprint scanner is bad. Almost 30percent time it fails for me.\\n\\nFace recognition is also little bit slow. However it recognizes in dark which is a good thing.\\n\\nPhysical buttons are good and sturdy\\n\\nMic works fine\\n\\nConclusion\\nI am impressed with this phone and would be using Samsung only when I replace this 3 years down the line. Honestly budget category for mobiles is so good that it doesn't make much sense to go above unless you are a gamer or a camera enthusiast. By the time you are reading this review this phoen would be obselete but I recommend these budget Samsung phones.\",\n",
       " 'Here is my long term review of my samsung m31. I have used it for almost a year and overall have a positive feeling about it . The display is good , no complaints . Gorilla glass 3 has saved my phone to a certain extend. The processor used is decent for daily usage and some casual games. Coming to the camera , it is good in outdoor lighting and decent in indoor lighting conditions. The front camera however could have been better. The one UI is good and gives a nice experience. The battery gives me a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours with always on display on . May extend upto 10 hours sometimes. The speakers are loud enough but could have been slightly better though . Also I did not face much of connectivity issues . The phone does get a bit warm near the camera after charging but eventually become cool in 10 to 15 minutes. Overall, to sum it up , I would give a rating of 8/10 after using this phone for almost a year...',\n",

       " 'Overall its a good value for money device with a monstrous 6000 mAh battery 64 MP quad camera along with a 32 MP selfie camera. The Exynos 9611 SoC can handle most of the intense graphic games effortlessly. The OS does not load any ads unless the user chooses to. The privacy management is User centric where we can manage app data participate in marketing and advertisement etc.. .Users even can opt to receive ads the revenue from it is linked to users samsung account which can be donated to UN missions based on the users choice. This device (and most of M series devices) does not come with Knox security but still Samsung has provided many cryptographic modules and security applications to the device which makes it far more secure than other devices of same price segment.\\nThat said, the device though having a powerful AI backed Camera, Does not come with a fully featured Pro mode users cant even control shutter speed. Samsung likely provide it in future updates.Also the OS is ONE UI 2.0 Core thus some premium Samsung features are not available. The night mode is awesome and the video mode has electronic image stabilization. Some features like internet speed indicator and screen recording are absent, but can be managed with 3rd party apps.The game launcher is amazing providing good optimization for games. The battery is good and one can easily manage to get a 9 hr screen on time even with mild gaming. The device comes with built in Dolby Atmos audio which gets activated when the headphone is plugged in, and along with SuperAmoled display it is perfect for binge watching. Also it is Wide-vine l1 certified for streaming.',\n",

Watching videos on this device is really great. Sound quality is superb. Dolby Atmos technology gives almost theatre like experience. External speaker is good. Rear camera quality is fine but front camera is not satisfactory. I can't give five out of five because of the performance of the front camera. Build quality meets my expectation.

The Security Updates are regular and would be monthly available for next 3 years as per Samsung.\\n8.

Lightweight which makes it easy to handle. When e comes over the display to is awesome. Large display. The fingerprint reader is pretty good to. The quality of the sensor I can feel it. Moreover the battery life. I charge my phone once a day . Which will last up to 22-23 hours. The only problem is the fast-charging. But I'm very satisfied with its performance. I can use 6000mh battery upto 23 hours and charges for 2 and a half hour. Now let's talk about the camera. Simply perfect. 64 mp main gives me perfect shots when need. While comes to wide-angle shot it makes difference in quality. But overall camera is good. Live-focus makes the photo live. Macro shots are awesome to. Quad camera is perfectly arranged to in this place. Strong flash to. It can also use as strong flashlight in the night. Wait I just forget to tell about camera options, Samsung provides more options like macro, pro, night, panaroma, slowmo, super-slowo, hyperlapse and food which gives you complete satisfaction. And budget is perfect. For a mid-range customer Samsung M31 is perfect and would be the best choice for you under 19,000. It is actually a monster!!!. King of mid-range phone's. Processors is not like other Samsung phones. M31 has less lag. Faster. Speakers are very loud and clear. Under 20,000 the best phone you can get when look to battery, processor, camera, and data your personal data security. You can trust Samsung. This trust gives us M31 the real monster in this range. No phones from other companies can compete with it in battery under this range. It is actually a MONSTER!!!\",\n",

Overall the build quality is fantastic with a super fast physical fingerprint scanner and the quad-camera system performs quite well in daylight and the focus is also brilliant (both back and front camera). Again it's not the best for night captures yet you can't say it's bad. The 6000 Mah battery doesn't feel like it's one though lasts all day if you aren't that a heavy user.

All the 4 cameras has got terrific skills to bring up exotic pictures.\\nGreat Battery life- Expect upto 1.5 days of battery life if you are a casual user but do note that as this phone only supports 15W fast charging it would take around 3hrs to fully charge the device from 0-100.\\nSuper Amoled display gives an exotic viewing experience as usual found in Samsung phones\\nGreat memory management which easily handles the apps in the background without being killed.\\nThe One UI 2.0 makes it a clean and cool gadget.\\nConcluding I would like to say that if you are looking for a smartphone with Great Cameras, Battery life, display then the Samsung Galaxy M31 is made for you.\\nI can say it's the safest android phone at the price point where it comes with no bloatwares or ads in unlike the Chinese mobile brands.\\nLike the name suggests it's a Monster in Camera, Battery & Display.\\nIt's also light weight when compared though it has got a massive 6000Mah battery.\\nI don't play games on phone so can't say about that\\nI have been using the 6GB RAM+128GB Storage since one month, and in my experience I am in love with this Monster #SamsungGalaxyM31\",\n",
       " \"An awesome phone, with an absolutely excellent display and UI.\\n\\nPros\\n- Best display in range (and even beyond). The super Amoled display not only provides a vibrant display but also provides great viewing angles and the colors on the screen really come out well. Plus, the Always on display is a unique and impressive feature though not much useful.\\n- Samsung's OneUI is a pleasure to use. Lots of features, easy management of apps and notifications. Adding to that, Android 10 experience is also really good.\\n- Battery life is much more than sufficient. Even after heavy usage and extensive video/audio playing, it lasts a bit more than a day. It sure does take some time to charge but that's worth the wait as the phone lasts for about two days with normal use and one complete day with heavy usage.\\n- Camera clarity is good and provides a lot of modes, for shooting stills and videos.\\n- Non-Chinese brand :')\\n\\nCons\\n- Not the fastest charger in the segment.\\n- The back panel is plastic, which does not look as premium as other phones in the price segment, but since I use a back cover anyway it doesn't matter much.\\n- I don't do much gaming but from other reviews, it seems it doesn't perform as good.\\n- That's pretty much it.\\n\\nGo for it. A great phone for working professionals who aren't into gaming and need their phone for texting, content watching and basic management tasks.\",\n",
       " \" I bought this phone for my mother and she is very happy with the device. The biggest reason I choose this was the massive battery and the battery life it offers. It even lasts 2 days without any charge on casual usage. The camera quality is good in day light and in well lit environments but not in low light. The UI is quite simple and the display quality is great. I'd choose an 60Hz panel with good color quality over a 120hz with bad color reproduction anyday.\\nOverall, this phone is a great choice for those casual users who want a device with great battery life and display.\",\n",

The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.\\n- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.\\n- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160.

Brand: Cannot be more happier buying a Non-Chinese brand, if you are confused between this phone & other Chinese brand...without a doubt buy this, its all worth.\\n6.

Battery: It has a 6000mAh battery. It always lasts around 2 days if you use the phone above moderate level. If you don't use your phone much, it will last way more than that.\\n3. Performance: It was overall very smooth. Didn't lag at all during my use. Since it had 6gb ram it worked really smooth. Would Highly recommend if you want good performance.\\n4.

The phone is slightly heavy which makes it easy to hold .\\n9. it has fast charge feature\\n\\nCons.\\n1: The fingerprint sensor is not very fast. But still reasonably fast.\\n2. Camera has a lot of options that make it slightly complicated. The 64 Mp mode won't be turned on initially so you will have to switch to it if you want. In the 64 M.P mode zooming is not there also it is in 3:4 aspect ratio. It's ok since you can crop it later. Also in night the picture quality won't be that good.\\n3. Lack of I.R blaster is not much of a con\\n4. Headphones are not included in the package.\\n5. The charging time is around 2 hrs.\\n\\nOverall it's a really good option for the price.

Excellent camera hub-pictures taken are very sharp and lifelike, Ample battery capacity, Super smooth operation and fast processing speed, good voice clarity, dual SIM 4G LTE internet connerivity and calls get connected well on poor network coverage areas too. Not yet tried WiFi but I'm confident it'll be great too.\\n\\nAndroid 10 Software performance is very good. It has excellent display with Blue light and Dark mode display. No heating issues, No lagging. Face unlock and Finger Print sensor are very responsive and accurate. Attention has been given to design for weight balancing...it's not very heavy but due to balanced weight appear lighter. Awesome device from Samsung.\",\n",
       " 'It is my true review after using 4 days samsung m31 prime edition\\nLook is nice\\nSelfie camera is good\\nFinger sensor is little slow\\nBattery life is good but takes time to full charge\\nMain fault is that my music and video player voice is coming at all and ringer also not producing sound only vibration coming\\nIt happens automatically slow and high sound problem anytime',\n",
       " \"This is an awsome phone in this price range. This phone has a camera which does most of the work for you. You just need a vision, and you will get fabulous pictures. The wide angle camera is very helpful as it lets you capture extra. The fingerprint scanner is very smooth and it never lags. The front camera is so nice that it makes almost every kind of face photogenic. You can just forget about everything else and click awsome selfies anytime, anywhere. No need to worry about your best angle. Click picture from any angle and the image processing software will do the rest and make you look like a Greek God. Once you've charged it 100% and Even if you keep your mobile data ON continuously, you won't need to charge it even after 48 hours or continuous internet usage.\\nThe battery life is so good that I keep my mobile data ON all the time and I take at least 5 online classes on Google meet a day and I need to charge it after 36 hours.\\nThis phone is hell of a work mule and this phone can take on everything thrown to it.\\nHats off to Samsung for making this...\",\n",

       " \"Giving this review after 4 days of use. I was the ios user but now I am realizing that spending too much on phones which people used to change in around two years is a waste of money. Hence shifted to Android (Galaxy M31).\\nFirstly I was thinking about Redmi Note 9 Pro Max, but since it is a product of Chinese Company, so stooped there only. Too much Patriotism :).\\n\\nPros-\\n- The phone looks beautiful.\\n- The display is awesome, played some 4k videos from youtube. Screen quality is really awesome. It also has Blue light filter functionality. You can schedule the same as per your need.\\n- The overall performance is good. No heating. Played general games (NFS etc) and it worked really well\\n- 6000 Mah battery is really big enough for me (comparing with iPhones). Lasts for almost 1.5 Days with general use.\\n- 64 GB storage is sufficient and you can expand it to 512 GB with an external card.\\n- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE\\n- Fast charging and 15W charger top with the phone. The phone came with a 30% charge. Charged fast.\\n- The camera is good. The macro camera works perfectly fine. Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160.\\nSince I am not a photographer, this is more than enough for me.\\n- Fingerprint and Face recognition is good (Don't want to compare with apple.)\\n\\nCons -\\n- The phone is a little heavy and not slim (But it doesn't look bulky, it really looks awesome)\\n- There were some claims that it takes 160 minutes to charge from 0-100% which is wrong. This phone takes around 3.50 hours for full (0-100) recharge.\\n- There is no earpiece provided by Samsung.\\n\\nOverall this Phone is really a must buy in this price range. Don't go with negative reviews.\\n\\nI have seen some reviews where people are saying the camera is not good. It is not justifiable to compare its camera with DSLR or any other high-end phones (For example iPhone 11) as\\nYour DSLR can not make calls and much more other things what this phone can\\nand Other high-end phones like iPhone 11 don't come in 16000 Rs.\\nThe camera quality is really good and you can go for it.\",\n",
       " \"Battery life and speed is simply amazing, though I have not used for gaming. First Time I am hearing such forceful and clear Sound quality in any mobile,\\nI feel its better than even my laptop's sound quality. Dolby Atmos settings allow to further refine the sound quality. Screen resolution and brightness are good and color saturation can be adjusted through its few color mode presets in settings. Body/Build is quite strong. Phone MIc is clearly better and more sensitive than what I notice with my headset mic.\\nAllows two nano sims in 4G, and data can be selected though either sims and a setting is there to allow net use during calls. A separate slot is there for SD card.\\nI got 6GB/128GB and At this price, it is a very compelling deal. Would recommend it to anyone.\\nI have not noticed anything negative in this phone.\",\n",

Its really pride to use this device and using it is such a privilege\\nYou might think why i didn't mention any feature of the device so the reason is there are numerous and a lot features to explain and all the features are extraordinary and mindblowing dont think twice before buying just be ready with patience and order it,if you do so It will be counted as one of the most correct decision of your life..\",\n",

Better than iPhone 8 which I was using previously, and One Plus 5...\\n2. Battery life is just wow..with a full charge battery lasts up to 1 and a half day with high usage...\\n3. Still, I haven't faced any lag or hanging issues...\\n4. Screen resolution is good.\\n\\nCons:\\n1. The body is plastic which could have been better(metal).\\n2. Charging time is approx 5 hours for 0 to 100% charging, I prefer charging overnight which matches its requirement. Charging cable is very small which I understood is required for charging 6000 mah battery faster.\\n3. It feels heavy on your hand after holding one plus 5 it feels like you are holding a brick.\\n4. There's no headphone provided with the phone.so you need to buy a headphone additionally.\\n\\nConclusion: I am a tech-savvy person and I do travel a lot. this phone fits into all my requirements with great camera, good battery life and a lot more. After 4 months and a few days of usage, I haven't faced any issues with this phone apart from its charging time which is approx 5 hrs and keeps the juice up for one and half day.\",\n",
       " \"The phone is really awesome and worth to spend 16k on. It is very handy, looks nice (back should have been given some gradient design), and very light weight. Operation is very smooth. It is so user friendly that it assists searches, it has settings for almost everything you see on the phone which means you need not compromise with how it asssits you. The best thing I liked is its focus mode which is a must have in any student's phone...also we can create our own mode where we can decide which all applications we must be able to use while having a me time.6 gb + 128 gb is too much to get for 16k from such a reputed brand like samsung. I have been using this phone for past 3 days and it has not made me disappointed. This phone is made for normal users where all your needs are met. Voice quality is good on call, speakers are not so loud,battery backup is awesome with 6000 mah. Options to delete screenshots after sharing was another awesome feature. My gallery used to be flooded with unwanted screenshots and now its solved. Its size is also good. Enough for reading pdfs and watching movies and won't hurt your thumb after long use. I have a suggestion that the pack could have included a back cover also as most of midrange phones comes with backcover with it. Battery takes about 2 and a half hours to get fully charged from nearly 0. Phone comes with android 10. Photos taken are okay. I'm not a photography person. I'm really happy with my choice... Samsung has not disappointed me this time also. I happily suggest Samsung M31 to any normal user.\",\n",

       " \"At first glance, it is hard to distinguish between the Samsung Galaxy M30s (Review) and the Galaxy M31 from the front. Both smartphones sport big 6.4-inch displays with waterdrop notches, which Samsung calls Infinity U displays, The bezels aren't thin but are acceptable for the price. Just like with other M series smartphones, Samsung has used plastic in the construction of the Galaxy M31. The earpiece is sleek and sits right above the display in the frame of the smartphone.\\n\\nPick the Galaxy M31 up and it feels comfortable to hold in the hand. The sides are slightly curved which helps with grip. Samsung has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right of the device. The power button is easy to reach but the volume buttons could have been positioned better. On the left is the SIM tray which did not sit perfectly flush on our review unit. The Galaxy M31 has a 3.5mm headphone jack, primary microphone, USB Type-C port, and speaker at the bottom. The top only has the secondary microphone.\\n\\nWhen you look at the back of the Galaxy M31, you'll see some changes. The camera module is similar to that of the Galaxy M30s but it now packs a fourth camera. Next to this is the fingerprint scanner which was comfortable for us to reach while holding the smartphone.\\n\\nThe Galaxy M31 packs in a big 6,000mAh battery and weighs 191g makes the device feel a little heavy. Samsung has thankfully bundled a 15W charger in the box which should help keep charging times down. The company offers the Galaxy M31 in two colours, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We had the Space Black variant for review, and it picked up fingerprints and smudges very easily. There is no case in the box, so you may want to buy one.\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy M31 specifications and features\\nThe spec sheet of the Galaxy M31 looks similar to that of the Galaxy M30s. It sports a 6.4-inch AMOLED display with a full-HD+ resolution. It also has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection which should keep it from picking up scratches too easily. The display has good viewing angles and is legible when outdoors. There are two colour profiles to choose from, and you can also change the white balance.\\n\\nSamsung has retained the Exynos 9611 SoC from the Galaxy M30s. This is an octa-core processor with four performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.3GHz and four efficiency Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. For graphics, it has the Mali-G72 GPU. You get 6GB of RAM and a choice between a 64GB storage variant and a 128GB storage variant for Rs. 15,999 or Rs. 16,999 respectively. However, Samsung is offering a Rs. 1,000 discount which brings the prices down to Rs. 14,999 and Rs. 15,999 respectively. The duration of this offer has not been specified.\\n\\nSamsung has bumped up RAM on the Galaxy M31 compared to its predecessor which should give it some leverage while multitasking. We did not notice any lag or stutter while using the smartphone. The device is fairly quick to load up apps however big apps do take slightly longer. Since there is plenty of RAM, multitasking is a breeze and we did not find ourselves waiting for an app to load all over again.\\nThe fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock the smartphone, and the selfie camera does a decent job with face recognition. We enjoyed watching content on the AMOLED display. There is Widevine L1 support which should let you stream full-HD content.\\n\\nWe ran our usual benchmarks on the Galaxy M31. In AnTuTu, it managed to score 191,981 points which are higher than the Galaxy M30s did. The Galaxy M31 also scored 348 and 1,247 respectively in Geekbench's single-core and multi-core tests. As for graphics benchmarks, the Galaxy M31 managed 41fps in GFXBench T-Rex and 8.9fps in GFXBench Car Chase\",\n",
       " \"After using over 6 months\\nDislikes: the camera does not produces decent picture and degrading further.\\nThe battery now only stays for a day with normal usage so similar to other phones. Not seeing any big value with 6000mah\\n\\nEarlier review on first week of usage.\\nLikes : The phone looks stunning and packs great features. The best part 6000 MaH battery which never feels bulky as the weight is balanced so nicely. The phone comes with all positive features in good price point. The UI is easy to use and no useless preinstalled apps like Realme phones. It makes all sense to buy this device with name tag Samsung.\\n\\nDislikes: The camera could have been better. The back panel gets scratches easily during daily use and finger prints are easily noticeable. But this might be the case with most of the phones in this price range.\\n\\nConclusion : The phone is just a basic handset and cannot be used for long time like 2 or 3 years. The back of phone needs cover from first day else you end up with scratches and discoloration. It's not a great handset as it claims.\",\n",
       " 'The GALAXY M31 has been in my consideration since its launch as it created buzz prelaunch due to its features. This product is being projected as the leader in this segment. Now come to the real and first experience, this phone has delivered upon its feature. The Camera quality is amazingly better than other phones who are selling themselves on camera feature. The picture quality with real colors, several modes of photography proves its claim about the camera quality. The video shooting is also better as compare to the \"Camera Phones.\\nThe second feature which is very outstanding,despite speculation, is Battery capacity, performance and life. The Battery runs long(upto 20 hours) while using internet,Netflix or whatever OTT. The battery life also enhances Gaming and phone experience. The best thing, battery of such big capacity doesn\\'t make it hot while using full features. The accessibility and control are impeccably good. There is no lag while using or locking-unlocking. The fingerprint reader is also of higher quality. It performs way way better than other phones of this segment. Other features like screen resolution, touch also gives you more value for money. Overall this phone by Samsung in this price is a Big thumbs up, you\\'ll have a good experience while using GALAXY M31.',\n",

Without lagging &low heat up of phone only 20 to 25%battery reduce after 2 to 2.5 hour of gameplay. Other functions are great but samsung doing so much price cut by not giving earphone or back cover with the phone.

       " 'Samsung recently introduced its latest smartphone in the M-series with the launch of Galaxy M31. The smartphone comes with a host of interesting features and it is priced at Rs 14,999 for 6GB RAM + 64GB storage and Rs 15,999 for 6GB RAM + 128GB storage variant. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe latest smartphone from Samsung is loaded with a powerful 6,000mAh battery along with improved cameras and sleek design. So, is it enough to compete against the likes of Poco X2 and Realme 6? Let‚Äôs find out. \\nLet‚Äôs start with the first strong point of the Samsung Galaxy M31, the design. The phone is quite lightweight in spite of sporting a huge 6,000mAh battery. The phone is quite comfortable to hold in your hand, though the one-handed operation is not that great. The sides are slightly curved, which provides a good grip and the power button is each to reach. The phone is available in two colour options, Ocean Blue and Space Black. We got the latter for review and it sure looks premium, though it picks up fingerprints and smudges, so putting in a case is the best option. \\n\\nAnother area where the Galaxy M31 does a good job is the display. The smartphone is loaded with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ Infinity U display with a screen resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display delivers some good results as the colours were bright and text looked sharp in our testing. Furthermore, the phone supports Widevine L1 support, meaning that you can stream HD content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos. \\n\\n \\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Camera Review\\n\\n \\nThe Galaxy M31 offers you improved performance in terms of the cameras. The phone is loaded with a 64-megapixel main camera with f/1.8 aperture, an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with f/2.2 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with f/2.2 aperture, and 5-megapixel macro lens with f/2.4 aperture. For the front, there will be a 32-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture. \\n\\n \\nThat said, the camera performance is quite decent in the daylight conditions. The photos came out to be punchy and well-detailed. The phone does a good job in taking macro shots, though you need to get used to it. The wide-angle lens offers you a better field of view, though detailing goes for a toss in this mode. The selfie performance is decent as well, though you might find some oversaturation in the photos.\\n\\n In low light conditions, the Samsung Galaxy M31 does an average job. In our testing, we found out the photo taken in low light conditions shows loss of quality. The details are not that impressive in nature and you will notice lots of grains and noises in the image. The wide-angle mode in the low light also performs quite average in our opinion as the results were not at all impressive. The Night mode comes to the rescue and the photos came out to be slightly better using Night Mode in the camera, though it automatically zooms in up to 2x when you switch to this mode. This some times spoils the whole composition, which can be frustrating at times. Moving on, the Live Focus mode is not that amazing as the edge detection still needs some improvements. \\n\\nSamsung Galaxy M31: Battery and Security Review\\n\\n \\nThe smartphone is loaded with a 6,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging support. The major highlight of the Galaxy M31 is the battery backup. In our testing, we found out that the phone delivers up to 2 days of battery backup under normal to mixed usage. Even if you do lots of gaming or stream content, the battery life will not disappoint you. Coming to the charging speeds, the smartphone takes up to 2 hours to get from 3 per cent to 100 per cent. \\n\\n \\nComing to the security, the phone is loaded with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor along with face unlock feature. The fingerprint sensor works just fine and you will not face any trouble while unlocking the smartphone. Furthermore, the face unlock feature works good in well-lit conditions, though it shimmers a bit in low-light areas. \\n\\n Samsung Galaxy M31: Performance Review\\n\\n The Samsung Galaxy M31 is powered by a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. This is the same chipset, which is found in Galaxy A51. The chipset provides some good results in day-to-day scenarios and you will not face any kind of lag or shutter. When it comes to multi-tasking or pushing the phone, it shows some sign of lag. In the gaming section, one can play casual games like Subway Surfers, Johnny Triggers and more without any lag, however, when it comes to high-end games like PUBG Mobile or Asphalt series, the phone does a decent job as well. That said, you will notice that the phone warms up quite a bit during extended gaming sessions. \\n\\n \\nOn the software front, the Galaxy M31 runs on Android 10 with company‚Äôs custom user interface OneUI 2.0 running on top of it. The user interface is refined as compared to the previous versions and you get new Dark Mode, which is a good thing. Apart from this, you get gesture-based navigation controls along with Focus Mode, Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls. Apart from this, you get some standard features like double-tap to wake, gesture-based screenshot and more. On the downside, you still see a lot of bloatware in the phone including Google and Microsoft app suites along with other apps like Netflix, Facebook, Samsung Max and more. My Galaxy application is one annoying app that keeps sending you to push notifications throughout the day.',\n",

Poco x2, redmi note 9 pro etc....\\n\\nThe battery is just great, last for 1 and half days, and some people are saying charging time is more than 3 hrs, thats not true, it charges in roughly 2 to 2 and a half hour.\\n\\nOne UI 2.0 is the most beautiful UI , you cannot even compare it with MiUI or any other ui, since its Ad free and just so easy to use.\\n\\nThe camera is beast in this one with soooo many features. No complaints there.\\n\\nThe processor is also really good, handles all day to day tasks plus games like pubg pretty easily, if you play pubg for 1 hour , it will drain only 10 to 12 % of battery.\\n...........\\nCons\\n..........\\n\\nOnly thing i didn't really like is that its not a slim phone, if you get a case and toughened glass, it gets pretty thick.\\nIf you are okay with that like me...then don't think much just go for it. üòç\",\n",
       " \"I have wanted to buy this phone ever since I saw it would be launching. But I had to wait 2 months for several reasons before I got it.\\nA piece of advice if you do buy it.. Please charge the phone completely before using it for the first time. It's really helpful. I've read many reviews here and everyone who found it faulty probably didn't charge it to 100% before first use (It does gets heated the first time. Don't worry about it.) Now to the review. Waiting two months eagerly for this... my expectations were as high as it could be and my phone did meet it to a great extent.\\nFingerprint reader is great though sometimes it does not recognize on the first try. But again for the budget it's pretty good.\\nThe display has to be the biggest pros of the phone. I was so obsessed with it I didn't even want to use a screenguard XD. It is very smooth and videos look great on it.\\nThe back of the phone also looks very attractive despite what I've read about it. It does get fingerprints all over it but nothing that can't be rid of.\\nFace unlock I had to try just for the review and it is pretty good. (Keep in mind I tried it only for a few minutes, just a couple tries)\\nBattery life is really good. I usually binge watch TV shows on my phone and it would last for a day and a half. When I tried gaming, I didn't find any freezing or lagging. But the battery does start reducing a little more quickly ( It would still last for the whole day) and sometimes heats up but nothing to be worried about.\\nComing to the camera, the default camera is 16MP and you'll have to change it to 64MP and you can't zoom in using 64MP. Also it takes up more space. But the camera quality is pretty awesome. However the video and every other mode are in 16MP. The front camera default is 16MP too I presume, and ultrawide front camera is 21MP and you can change it to 32MP. The front camera is great too. However I don't recommend the phone to hardcore photo enthusiasts considering it might not meet your expectations. But keeping the budget in mind I give it 5 stars. The video mode is good however the super steady mode is very grainy.(I'm not sure how exactly it works yet). And the super slo-mo video can only be used in daylight for best results. Photos in lowlight are not the best. But there is a flash option for front camera where the screen goes bright white during a shot and it compensates really well. I was happy with most of the camera features but it isn't the best being a photo enthusiast myself. It still does a great job nonetheless. The performance is amazing.\\nTalking about storage the system takes up 16GB and other 4GB gets used up while setting up. You basically get 108GB give or take as your storage(For 128GB variant). It's been almost 11 days since I got the phone and it's done a great job of impressing me and my family. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a budget friendly smartphone. And to those trying to cut off Chinese products.Overall I have had a pretty awesome and exciting experience with it so a five star rating. Totally would recommend.\\n\\nUpdate: 3 months later\\n\\nStill very good. Camera quality is really awesome now I've played with it enough. But battery life is not completely to the mark of 6000 mAh but it's still pretty great. Would recommend Samsung m31s now. But if you can't afford that this is the best choice for you.\",\n",

Here are the pros and cons:\\nPROS:\\n1. 6000mAh battery that easily lasts for more than a day.\\n2. 6 GB RAM that makes switching between tasks very smooth and quick.\\n3. Quad camera setup takes excellent pictures. (The photo of the box was taken on the M31.) The 32 megapixel front camera also takes great selfies.\\n4. The super Amoled display is on par with all the flagship devices. Amazing viewing experience.\\n5. Comes with latest Android 10.\\n6. Although the processor isn't a flagship chipset, it can easily handle games like Asphalt 9, Call of Duty Mobile, PUBG, etc. at high graphics without any visible lag.\\n7. Manufactured in India. During this time when boycott of Chinese goods is on the rise, this is the best alternative to any other Chinese branded phone on the market at the price range.\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Certain aspects of OneUI 2.0 are missing. Like edge lighting, secure folder, knox security, which are available on models like A51, which runs on the same chipset.\\n\\nFinal review: Although certain aspects available on other samsung models are not on the phone, the pros heavily outweigh the cons, making this one of the best value for money smartphones. Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a phone between ‚Çπ15,000 to ‚Çπ20,000.\",\n",

Picture quality is amazing and the super Amoled screen is just icing on the cake viz super smooth and crisp and responsive mind it you are just paying 17 or 18k for a samsung product with these specs.\\n\\nGaming:\\nI don't find any issues with this phone as far as gaming is concerned. I play pubg with mo lag at all at smooth ultra resolution. Yes, HDR ultra or HD Extreme is a bit laggy after sometime (30 min ) but you can play with HD extreme with issues and will be so much fun.\\n\\nIt is worth buying for someone who is looking for a feature packed phone with Korean tech and an alternate for chinese viz useless to spend upon as most of the chinese creates problem as soon as your warranty is over.\",\n",

       " \"TRENDING\\n\\nBEST MOBILES\\n\\nUPCOMING PHONES\\n\\nTOP NEWS\\nHome ¬ª Mobile ¬ª Reviews\\nSamsung Galaxy M31: The Good, The Bad, And The X Factor\\nBy Sandeep Sarkar\\nUpdated: Friday, March 20, 2020, 16:56 [IST]\\n\\nSamsung has added a new handset in the Galaxy M series dubbed Galaxy M31. The company introduced this series last year to compete against its Chinese counterparts like Xiaomi and Realme who own a major chunk of the market with feature-rich smartphones being offered an affordable price tag.\\n\\nThe latest entrant comes as a successor to the Galaxy M30s which has been quite popular in the mid-range segment. Carrying some traits from its predecessor, the Galaxy M31 is packed with a humongous 6,000 mAh battery and an L-shaped quad-camera module.\\n\\nAt a starting price label of Rs. 14,999 for the 6GB RAM+64GB storage and Rs. 15,999 for the 6GB RAM+128GB storage model, it goes up against the likes of the Honor 9X, Redmi Note 8 Pro, and the Realme XT. Let's see what this device brings to the table and how good is it against the Chinese rivals in our initial impressions:\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy M31: The Good\\nHigh-Resolution Super AMOLED Display\\n\\nThe first thing that will grab your attention while buying this handset is its big high-resolution display. Samsung has equipped the Galaxy M31 with a 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display that churns out 1080 x 2340 pixels FHD+ resolution and has a tall 19:5:9 aspect ratio. Samsung has never compromised with the display quality; which seems evident on the Galaxy M31 as well.\\n\\nThe tall display complemented by high-resolution support makes it suitable for 1080p videos. Moreover, the narrow bezels all around the display give you the maximum area to watch content. The U-shaped notch is slightly bigger.\\n\\nThe colors delivered are punchy and vivid, something which you will find on other mid-range Samsung smartphones as well. The viewing angles and sunlight visibility seems good. But, we will be able to give feedback after a thorough usage. It is worth noting that this is the same display that the company had used on its predecessor, i.e, the Galaxy M30s. So, you can expect the same display output.\",\n",
       " 'The Galaxy M31 has a polycarbonate body that‚Äôs pretty much the same as the Galaxy M30s. Since there‚Äôs a 6,000 mAh battery inside, the M31 is heavy, but not so heavy that it would turn you off. However, the phone doesn‚Äôt feel very premium to hold, and that might not be to everyone‚Äôs liking despite the rather affordable price tag. The design is quite utilitarian, in short, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your preferences.\\n\\nAt the back, the quad camera setup is housed inside a rectangular window in the upper left corner, with the words ‚Äô64 megapixels‚Äô mentioned next to the LED flash. It may come off as cheap to some, but in my opinion the font used for the text makes it look quite stylish. There‚Äôs also a capacitive fingerprint sensor next to the cameras, which I still think is the best solution for fingerprint recognition on phones.\\n\\nThe 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy M31 is excellent for this segment of the smartphone market. It has wide viewing angles, vivid colors, deep blacks, and pretty good brightness levels that only fall short in the harshest of sunlight. However, since this is the same panel as the one on the Galaxy M30s, the bezels are rather big for a 2020 smartphone. The bottom bezel in particular is an eyesore, though I guess we can‚Äôt complain considering the M31‚Äôs price tag.\\n\\nThe Galaxy M31 has a headphone jack, for those wondering. But you will have to buy your own headphones, as there are no earphones in the box. There‚Äôs no case, either: All you get is a USB-C cable and a 15W Samsung fast charger, which was also the case (no pun intended) with the Galaxy M30s. You will need a case, though, if you want to keep the phone in a pristine condition, as the back panel picks up scratches very easily.\\n\\nGalaxy M31 camera\\nThe M31 is Samsung‚Äôs cheapest phone to feature a 64-megapixel rear camera, and using pixel binning, it takes 16-megapixel photos in auto mode. And daytime performance is pretty good. There‚Äôs plenty of detail in the photos and good dynamic range. The same goes for video recording. The M31 is also the cheapest Samsung phone to sport 4K video recording (at 30 fps), and apart from a lack of stabilization, videos captured in daylight look pretty good.\\n\\nIt‚Äôs the nighttime performance where the M31 drops the ball. First off, the phone simply has too much shake even when you hold it in two hands, and with a single hand, well, good luck getting a perfectly clear picture. If you do manage it, you get sufficient detail and little noise when there‚Äôs good artificial lighting around. In the dark, things aren‚Äôt so rosy. Samsung is marketing the M31 as having an amazing camera Night mode, but that Night mode isn‚Äôt exactly that great.\\n\\nFirst off, the Night mode photos are cropped considerably so you see a lot less in the frame compared to standard photos. Secondly, Night mode photos have a watercolor painting effect and often have their detail smudged when it should be the other way around. Finally, some scenes don‚Äôt show noticeable difference when captured in Night mode. Night mode is great for brightening up a scene when it‚Äôs too dark, but otherwise, it doesn‚Äôt really work as well as Samsung would make you think.\\n\\nHere are a couple of photos captured both in auto mode and in Night mode:\\n\\nThe ultra-wide camera on the M31 is an 8-megapixel sensor like the M30s‚Äô ultra-wide camera. It‚Äôs useful to capture a wider scene, but don‚Äôt expect to see any fine detail when you zoom in, especially at night. As for the 5MP macro camera, it‚Äôs great if you love taking close-up shots, though it‚Äôs often difficult to understand exactly when the object is in focus, resulting in a few out-of-focus shots.\\n\\nHere are a few samples from the rear cameras, including ultra-wide and macro shots.\\n\\nFor selfies, the Galaxy M31 has a 32MP camera and manages to take pleasing pictures outdoors. By default, you get 8MP photos, but you can switch to 32MP mode if you like to see more details in your selfies. At night, detail is lost whether it‚Äôs an 8MP photo or a 32MP photo, and you can also expect some camera shake if you don‚Äôt hold the phone steady using all the willpower you can muster.\\n\\nIn case you‚Äôre wondering, you can capture 4K videos with the front camera as well. Other camera features include Live Focus mode for bokeh shots with the front and rear cameras, which works pretty well most of the time (see some samples below). You can also capture Super Slow-mo and standard slow motion videos and create AR Emojis. Standard modes like Hyperlapse and Panorama are present as well.\\n\\nThe Galaxy M31 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M30s, Galaxy A50s, and Galaxy A51. It‚Äôs the processor choice for Samsung‚Äôs budget and lower mid-range phones, and all I can say is that it gets the job done in day-to-day use. The M31 runs smoothly as long as you don‚Äôt try to switch apps and browse through the user interface too quickly. Apps mostly launch quickly, and since there‚Äôs 6GB of RAM on both the 64GB and 128GB storage variants, multitasking isn‚Äôt usually an issue.\\n\\nGaming performance is pretty good in titles like Call of Duty and PUBG, at least at the default graphics settings. The phone can stutter here and there when you initially load a game and start playing, but those stutters don‚Äôt show up after the first minute or two. It also didn‚Äôt have issues running well at the ultra frame rate setting in PUBG, and games like Asphalt 9 and Modern Combat 5 also run fine. This is something I also noticed on the Galaxy A50 and M30s ‚Äì the Exynos 9610/9611 isn‚Äôt great for the general user interface, but its Mali-G72 MP3 GPU handles popular gaming titles very well.\\n\\nGalaxy M31 software\\n\\nLike every other Galaxy phone Samsung has launched in 2020, the Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 with One UI 2.0 out of the box. Well, it runs One UI Core 2.0, which is a stripped down version of One UI 2.0 that Samsung also brought to the Galaxy M20 and Galaxy M30 with the Android 10 update. You don‚Äôt get features like the built-in screen recorder or even something as basic as Secure Folder. Samsung Pay and Samsung Pay Mini aren‚Äôt supported, either. Bixby is completely missing as well, except for Bixby Vision in the camera app.\\n\\nAnd when I pressed Samsung about why the M series runs One UI Core even though devices like the M30s and M31 have the same processor as the Galaxy A51, which do get standard One UI 2.0 (though not with all features), I was told the company designs each phone according to the target market. But that doesn‚Äôt explain why stuff like Samsung Pay Mini and Secure Folder aren‚Äôt part of the package, and I can only assume Samsung wants to keep some features exclusive to costlier phones.\\n\\nSince the Galaxy M31 runs Android 10 out of the box, it will receive an update to Android 11 and Android 12 at some point. Android 11 might arrive quickly ‚Äì the Galaxy M20 and M30 received the Android 10 update before the Galaxy Note 10 did, after all. Security updates are likely to come once every three months for the first two years, and whenever necessary from the third year onward.\\n\\nGalaxy M31 battery life\\n\\nWith a 6,000 mAh battery under the hood, it‚Äôs no wonder the Galaxy M31 can last a really long time on a single charge. I always got a full day of battery life with heavy usage, and with light to not-too-heavy use, you won‚Äôt have to charge it until late evening the next day, at least if you stick to mostly Wi-Fi. Switching to LTE brings down battery life, naturally, but you can still get a full day out of it with fairly heavy use.\\n\\nThe M31 supports 15W fast charging. With such a big battery, faster charging speeds don‚Äôt matter that much, and given the price point Samsung is targeting with the M series, we probably won‚Äôt see the fast charging specification change any time soon. Still, it would be nice to have, as a full charge from 0 takes around two hours and a half. An hour of charging takes the charge to around 30 percent, though that 30 percent does last a considerable while.\\n\\nGalaxy M31 audio and call quality\\n\\nThe M31 has a single bottom-firing loudspeaker that gets the job done if you‚Äôre in a small room but is too quiet to hear even at full volume otherwise. It‚Äôs the same story with every budget Galaxy phone, and the M31 doesn‚Äôt do anything to change that. Like the M30s‚Äô speaker, the M31‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt distort at the highest volume, though, which is a plus. It could just do with a bit more depth in the low frequencies (bass).\\n\\nFor wired audio, you will need to opt for a third-party product as no earphones are bundled with the phone. When used with earphones from other budget/mid-range Galaxy smartphones, the M31 produces sound that is very heavy on the high frequencies (treble) but lacks punch in the lower frequencies. As for call quality, I noticed no issues with either of the two SIMs I was using, except for the fact that both the earpiece and the loudspeaker are on the quieter side and make it hard to hear what the person on the other end is saying.\\n\\nGalaxy M31 verdict\\n\\nThe Galaxy M31 is more or less a Galaxy M30s with a macro camera, a higher-resolution main camera, more RAM on the base variant, and newer software out of the box. And the Galaxy M30s‚Äô base variant, priced at Rs 12,999, is the better pick if you‚Äôre on an extremely tight budget. If you have Rs 14,999 lying around, then the Galaxy M31 offers excellent value for money. It would have been nice to see more feature-packed software, better quality from the 64MP rear camera in low light, and perhaps an Infinity-O display with smaller bezels, but for the asking price, these are all nitpicks that shouldn‚Äôt affect your decision to get the phone.',\n",

I had done bit of gaming as well and I could say I'm satisfied with the performance. The best thing is it's UI, I felt super comfortable with it and it was like it learns my usage pattern. The phone feels smooth while working even on heavy usage. The best part of it, for which M31 has all the hype, the battery back up is really very good.

Decent camera quality!\\n\\nProcessor with enough power, bestial battery, camera with a lot of quality, a very acceptable amount of RAM, I have no complaints with anything about this mobile and 128GB of internal storage, I did not even consider using the microSD slot since 128GB is more than enough for me.',\n",

       " 'The Galaxy M31 is comfortable to hold in the hand but is a little heavy at 191g. The weight of the smartphone is mainly because of the big 6,000mAh battery that it packs.

It has two storage variants to choose from, 64GB and 128GB.The 6.4-inch Infinity-U Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy M31 is excellent for this segment of the smartphone market. It has wide viewing angles, vivid colors, deep blacks, and pretty good brightness levels that only fall short in the harshest of sunlight.

This phone has sAmoled display, quite loud speakers, type c charging port, amazing aesthetic visuals, sturdy outer body and fast charging. They still have provided a heqdphone jqck in this phone. But the main feature of this phone is its 6000mah battery. I work in a 9 to 6 job, and have my mobile internet on the whole time, due to which my previous phone's battery used to drain fast and it did not run for even half a day. I had to carry a power bank or a charger with me everywhere, which was not feasible. But since I bought this phone, I did not have to complain about battery even once, as even after heavy usage all day, my phone still retains 35% battery by the time I connect it to charger at night. Moreover, the phone is still not very heavy even after having such a big battery.\\n\\nThe phone has 4 cameras on back and one on front. The camera provides high quality and very clear photos. The people who love instant shots will love the camera. There are a lot of features provided with the phone such as time lapse, super slow, bokeh and many others.\\n\\nIt has 128gb storage (which is expandable) , which should be enough for most people now a days. The 6gb ram and their highly efficient in-house exynos processor ensures that there is no lag anytime anywhere.\\n\\nThe only main complaint I have with this phone is that samsung one ui doesn't support 3 finger screenshot and instead provides palm swipe screenshot, which is not comfortable at all. Most of the time, it doesn't work. I really hope they provide 3 finger screenshot option in the next update.\\n\\nIn the next iteration of this phone they can provide a faster charging option (more thwn to 15 watt) , a screen with faster refresh rate, more efficient processor and other minor upgrades.

       " \"I have been an Samsung S7 edge user before this and bought Redmi note 8 pro and Mi A3 for my wife and Mom, and used those extensively and this review is based on a comparison of all these phones.\\nPros:\\nFirstly M31 is at its price point of 16k for the 128GB model is amazing with its overall camera performance and Battery life. The camera is definitely better than the note 8 pro. The 32MP selfie camera has the right colors output for Indian faces.\\nMy S7 edge's amoled screen was incomparably with the budget phones till now, but the amoled screen in the M31 didn't disappoint me at all. The 5MP macro lens now makes more sense than the 2MP macro lens of Note 8 pro which I believe is useless. The M31 macro lens gave some really good shots.\\nAndroid 10 out of the box and Samsung's UI is definitely much better than Redmi or Stock android of Mi A3. For multimedia, this phone is really good with its screen quality and sound quality with Dolby atmos support.\\n\\nCons: Although people say you do not feel that the phone has a 6000 mah battery as it doesn't feel heavy but actually if you use the phone a lot and for longer durations, you will surely feel the weight. Now that is also because I use a back cover with the phone but again practically majority of us will use a back cover.\\nSecondly the phone is not powerful enough to play games for durations. After playing COD for 1 hour, the phones becomes a little hot and game play shows some lags. So definately not for gamers. The Note 8 pro is the best phone for gamers at a much lesser price.\\nFingerprint sensor is fast enough, not the fastest though. The only thing is they should have given in-display sensor on the front as if the phone is on the table I have to pick it up everytime to unlock.\\n\\nOverall for people like me who like a good lasting battery, a good screen and a good camera, this phone is perfect at this price point. Plus Samsung service which I have used a lot with older phones gives the edge to choose Samsung over others.\",\n",
       " \"Pros: Phone is quite sleek and handy. Camera is very good. Battery is like a monster. Made in India and non chinese company.\\n\\nCons: Gaming experience is bad, even while playing Ludo it's hanging. Many AI features which are generally there in any Chinese mobile missing, like 3 finger screenshot, interactive wizards etc.\",\n",
       " \"Received this from Amazon a week back. Here is review after a week's usage -\\n1) The build quality of phone certainly ferls premium for this budget.\\n2) Display is where I believe this device will surely outclass it's rivals. 6.4inch SAMOLED screen with FHD+ resolution looks gorgeous and colours pop out brilliantly. Even in direct sunlight I have no issues in seeing the content.\\n3) Camera quality is top notch even in low lighting conditions whether it be 64MP Rear cams or 32MP\\nFront, I infact felt the front camera better than my Galaxy Note 10+ in certain lighting conditions. Plus you get quad camera setup with ultra wide, macro and 4th cam for depth sensing, slow motion, 4k video shoot at 30fps.\\n4) Battery life is Terrific, 6000MAH lasts easily 2 days on a moderate usage with 4g Calls, WhatsApp, fee gaming, browsing and youtube content. Icing on the cake is it comes with a 15w fast charger which is superb.\\n5) Biometrics works just fine wether it's fingerprint or face unlock, accurate and fast.\\n6) Best part is it comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack which is quite a feature these days. Although Samsung could have provided a headphone with it which I feel is a mandate, but nevertheless the prescene of 3.5mm jack won't feel you sad about it.\\n7) Internal 6gb of ram and 64gb of storage for base model is quite decent and performance is is quite good. It's fast, there is no lag in any apps. Morever you can expand it via external micosd card upto 1TB.\\n8) It has an inbuilt FM Radio which was quite surprising feature. There is one bottom firing speaker which ain't stereo but it's quite loud. Can't expect everything at this pricepoint. Moreover you get Dolby Atmos feature as well so mulimedia experience is quite good.\\n9) It comes with android 10 and Samsung UI 2.0 which I think Samsung has done quite a good job balancing the design, features & usability where I think it's close to being the best software experience on an android. It's easy and clean to use.\\n10) Overall a well made device with a good usable feature set and good performance, great cameras, terrific battery and software experience. Would highly recommend it as one of the purchasing options while buying a phone in this pice range.\",\n",

       " 'I have been using this phone for over 2 months now. The major reason why I went for this model was its battery. After putting the phone to mild-high usage everyday (amdist the lockdown), the battery safely lasted just over a day (~26-28 hours). I use many services concurrently - Bluetooth, Data, GPS, Hotspot. So the battery drain in my device would be faster. In any normal use pattern, this battery can easily last a day and half. As far as charging is concerned, there are a lot of discussions online regarding the charging time for this model, as the charger comes with a 15W power capacity. From my experience, I would say, it charges fast untill it reaches a certain threshold afterwhich the charging becomes slow. So, you can expect your phone to buff up to around 40% battery in next to no time, but if you would like to completely charge the device, then leaving it plugged in as you sleep might be your best option\\nAnother great thing about Samsung M31 is its Camera. The front camera has 32MP and takes very beautiful selfies. In the Live Focus mode, you can blur off the background and obtain a high aperture-esque effect in your photos. The Macro mode is also very powerful and would be suited for subjects with high detail per unit area - an insect, a flower, a fruit etc. As a consequence, you will have to go up close to the subject to really appreciate the power of the Macro mode. This is made slightly difficult as the camera doesnt auto focus in the macro mode. But with Macro mode, you almost never get auto focus anyways. The main 64 MP camera is also quite sharp. Sometimes, you may be tempted to use the 64MP over the Macro Mode because of the quality the 64 MP camera packs in. I have not been able to step out and click landscape pictures using the 64 MP back camera, but if household images are to stand any testimony, this 64 MP beast must rival a mid range DSLR easily. If you download Lightroom from the App store (which is a free app by Adobe), you can get going with your new hobby and have some good impressionable snaps to show off. If you get used to these three camera modes, the other modes becomes largely redundant. Food mode and Night mode are probably helpful (Especially in low light)\\nOnly point where Samsung could have done better is the finishing of the product. The images put up on the website flatters the actual product. The back cover is a poly carbonate finger print magnet. It would be worth your money to invest in a back cover (As the package doesnt come with one included in it). Samsung has a lot of preloaded apps but you can uninstall most and for the ones which you cannot uninstall, you always have the option to mute notifications. The processor is a new chip and would obviously pale in comparison against the Qualcomms and Realteks, but with 15k you can only expect so much. I do not play large graphic intensive games on my device, so would not be able to tell the performance in those situations. But the phone holds itself in modest esteem when I tried Brawl Stars, Clash Royale, Plants Vs Zombies etc. Smooth and no problems. Media playback has also been satisfactory and the large screen really does help the resolution. Bear in mind, that for some videos on Youtube/Netflix/Prime, you wont be able to go the entire length of the screen. If you drag and stretch the video, you might fill the screen, but loose out on some details along the edges.\\nAll in all, this megamonster does good on all it promises and would really qualify as a great Value for Money option. If Battery and Camera is your thing, go for this product with your eyes closed!',\n",

The cameras are decent performers, not exceptional with the 64 mp and other lenses but not that bad also. Pictures are sharp and have less noise and good details in day light and somewhat decent even in artificial lighting. Performance is good and smooth for day to day work and the battery helps with that. Though it doesn't perform like a 6000 mah battery but still will get you over a full day. The charging takes around 2 and a half hours to go from 0 to 100. All in all its a pretty decent phone to use in 2020 and if you are just a normal user and want to use your phone for long periods of time without charging, then this is the one for you.

Easily runs through the day with maximum usage including moderate.l GPS navigation and high brightness.\\n\\n2. Display - Again no other brand can dare to compare. Not even iphone. Best display. Keeping this one short because i am short of words for this display.\\n\\n3. User Interface - Everything on point. One UI 2.0 is a treat to operate. Using samsung phone after a long time and it feels great to be back home after using MIUI ( xiaomi ) , EMUI ( Huawei ) and one plus. UI has all the important features and perfect placement to make it highly efficient and usefull. Screen transitions are joyful. Smoothness of another level. Feels like butter flowing under my fingers.\\n\\n4. Camera - I have attatched few sample images where you can really appreciate the amount of detail this beast can capture. 64 MP shots are crystal clear with very level of detail.\\nAgain i am short of words to explain the camera. Simply best camera phone under Rs 20,000. While all other brands keep explaining how you can use pro mode to make it intresting but in this phone you can simply point and shoot and results are always interesting.

The finger print sensor at the back is quickest indeed. And the battery life is super amazing too.

I would like to add a few cons, which I think should be taken into consideration while buying this:\\n1. No dash charging. Having used One Plus for quite a long, charging the phone becomes a bit painful for me. It takes close to 3 hrs to fully charged from zero. But, having a 6000 mah battery, it takes a lot to time to get drained as well. I was able to use this phone more than 24 hours on a single charge with quite heavy usage and screen time.\\n2.

       " \"I am using samsung M31 from last 5 months. I haven't find any lagging issue or any software glitches. Mobile is working very fairly. Only one drawback is that battery capacity is not 6000mAh as given in features. But I can say it has enough battery power to survive for longer time. If you want to buy a new smartphone below 20k I will definitely suggest you to go for it. Camera quality is also superb. If you ask me about heating issue, its upper body gets somewhat heated if you use camera for long time, but you will face this issue only in initial days(like first 20 odd days). I have mentioned all the issues over here. I haven't find any other issue. Software is also working properly. I hope this review will be helpful for you while purchasing this budget smartphone.\",\n",

That's what I love\\n\\nTo be honest, I was so worried about transferring the data from old phone to new one, but found out the Samsung Smart switch app, within minutes every single thing(means everything) from old phone to new got transferred, absolutely had nothing else to do apart from installing the apps.\\nAssistant is also quite nice.\\nFor me some things were hard to find in the new UI as I was used to other versions, but it has everything that other smartphones are offering and even better than others in the same price segment\\nSamsung Members is the place I found to be very helpful if anyone has any questions or issues to be discussed about the phone.\\nThe only thing that didnt impress me is the Dialer, its split in 3 parts (Keypad/Recent/Contacts), maybe i'm used to the one page Dialer thats why.\\nAlso the Notification menu, its quite big, I think considering the phone size its designed this way by Samsung.\\n\\nI'm glad I chose a great birthday gift for myself, I sure am satisfied with the product.

       " 'Talking about Samsung Galaxy M31, it is an amazing phone to spend money on. Some people say that Samsung has been using the same processor in most of its mobile ranges, but it seems to be best as per my opinion, as Qualcomm Snapdragon has been recently accused for stealing data, and on the other side, Mediatek Processors lack on remaining cool. So, I focused on the point on which the wishing buyers change the mind, and I did not highlight points about camera which is seemingly amazing, display which is bright and sharp and battery which is gigantic, because everyone get attracted to it, but after knowing the processor, they usually change their decision.\\nConclusion: It is a nice phone for daily usage and you should go for it.',\n",

       " \"I bought this the day it launched. The very moment it was available for sale and got it at an affordable price of ‚Çπ14999, delivered the same day via Amazon Prime. Its been almost 15 days of heavy use now\\n\\nWhat i liked:\\n-Amoled screen is sharp and crisp at displaying. No faulty viewing angles. Drop notch is super stylish and gives a flagship look to the device. Videos can be cropped to fit by the finger pinching out action. i have never seen Adaptive Brightness work so well in any phone.\\n-Fingerprint sensor is easy to reach at the back below the camera. Quick unlocking and Smart Unlock works well. Face unlock is accurate and works well too.\\n-Quad Camera setup is one of the sleekest cameras and positioning looks fabulous. The camera is quick to focus, great depth, the 64MP produces sharp images with a focus on the smallest details too. It has features like Pro, Hyperlapse, SlowMo, SuperSlowMo, Panorama, Night mode, Macro (wide), Bixby Vision, AR emoji, Food, 4k video and so much more. The front camera is better than what it looks like. It has perfect positioning, quick to focus and great attention to detail too. Overall, the cameras themselves make this phone worth a buy. Not just better in this range of phones but also than most flagship phones in 40-50k range.\\n-Android 10 & One UI2.1 are both very clean, precise and extremely easy to use. If you're on any os below 9, this will be a great upgrade.\\n-The biggest reason i bought this was the 6000mAh monster battery, it is not surprising that they do deliver their promise in this case too. The battery does not exhaust easily. Being a heavy user this battery, after charged fully, lasts around 2.5 days for me. The 15W type C charger that comes in the box takes about an hour to charge it from 0 to 100%.\\n-There is one external speaker towards the side of the charging port which produces clean and moderately loud sound. Dolby Atmos Sound is also an upgrade if you are looking for a surround sound experience. towards the other side of the charging port, you have a 3.5mm headphone jack.\\n-The Samsung Exynos 9611 processor lives upto its name. It is faster than i had expected it to be. Also, there are separate slots for memory and 2 sim cards which is a major pro.\\n-The phone in hand feels very light, despite its huge battery. The Ocean Blue colour looks sophisticated and might give the black variant competition.\\n-The box has a 15W fast charger with cable, user manuals, ejection pin.\\n\\nWhat I didn't like\\n-It might sound stupid but there is nothing that i did not like about the m31. Maybe they could have provided a headphone in the box but given the features of the phone at such a low price range, that is understandable. Other than that, the phone has delivered to all the claims that it made and I think it is one of the best phones i have owned so far. Great competition in this range. Highly Recommended.\",\n",
       " \"I am writing this review after 10 days.\\n1.CAMERA\\nI found the rare camera excellent. The photos speak for there selves but focus is not available in macro mode you have to make exact distance about 3cms to clearly have a nice shot, the night mode is very good. When you open Slow motion videos, you fell lag on the videos. I think it is a software problem because i have seen m30s capturing good slow motion videos by having exactly the same proccer, I hope samsung will solve this problem in future updates.\\nwhen we came to the front camera, i think samsung tried to improve the front camera from m30s. It is very great but suffers a little at night time.\\n2.BATTERY\\nThe 6000mah battery on this device is excellent, it last easly 2 days with moderete users. And can last a full day with heavy users so no need to worry about the battery.\\n3.DISPLAY\\nPerfect, no problem with that.\\n4.VALUE FOR MONEY\\nthe best from devices in this price segment.\\n5.FINGER PRINT AND FACE UNLOCK\\nfinger print is fast and secure, i have no problem with that.
